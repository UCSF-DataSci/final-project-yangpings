Latter_Company_3357,2024-02-12 17:07:36,"Stop using Zyn or any snus or nicotine pouches, please","i just created a reddit account to write you this, please listen. I am a University Computer Science Student and a heavy lifting addict. I used nicotine pouches and snus the past 5 years, mostly nicotine pouches(the white ones). I used a pack every 1 1/2 day. Everything was fine since one day i was going to the gym, and suddenly my brain felt like it is going to collapse, i looked for a place where i can sit but i was in public and i was afraid that i am gonna be knocked out there, so i ran to the gym. I never expereienced something like that, i was always 200 % healthy in my life never even had a migrane once ( i am 24 years old). So i was sitting in the gym til it got better, after that i still trained, idk why. everything went to normal and i could drive home with public transport. waking up the next day, drinking a coffe, taking snus, it started again but much much worse, also my belly was extremly bloated it felt like it cuts my air to breath off. you should know i am a very tough guy but i never experienced something like that and i was afraid, I live in a student dorm, without a family, i did not know what to do, i was afraid for my life that i die really. I called the ambulance, first time in my life, , and was almost not even able to walk to the car, because i almost passed out. i had a pulse of 200 the ambulance measured. The hospital said my blood was ok, nothing found and they threw me out. I called my parents to pick me up at [4.am](https://4.am) from another city. I lived 1 monht at my parents home and couldn't visit university and had to skip 1 semester. Also my neck was extremly stiff and i tought, everything was from working out my neck to hard LOL. I also took ashwaganda at the time and tought it caused it, so i stopped. It still persisted. I gained 20 kg fat weight, afraid to work out again. Suddenly i decreased taking nicotine pouches to test if maybe it is the reason. So instead of cold turkey i decreased the amount i take everyday, after 2 weaks i was off and suddenly the extreme belly bloat and neck stiffness went away, it fucked up my gut so bad that it fucked my life. i needed almost 1 year to fully recover, this is no joke. I took probiotics to heal my gut quickly and everything is fine now. PLESE STOP TAKING IT, i beg you, it fucks up your gut, honestly i think even smoking is healthier because if the gut is fucked up your life is not live worthy anymore. Please stop anyone, dont do cold turkey, do it slowly, it destroyed my life and i hope the damage it has done is reversable, learn from me. god bless.

Chemical_Raccoon_184,2025-03-10 01:36:33,Quit Zyns and went back to vaping ‚Äî never going back to using only pouches daily. They're not meant to be a primary nicotine source.,"I went from cigarettes to vaping. Then I switched to Zyns to quit vaping because everyone online kept saying they were the ""healthier"" option. But honestly, they‚Äôre not. Nicotine pouches and snus are actually one of the worst ways to consume nicotine long term.

There are two main reasons why:

1. You‚Äôre absorbing nicotine continuously for hours.


2. The total amount of nicotine absorbed is higher than most people realize.


For example:

8 Zyns at 6mg = 48mg total, around 26mg absorbed. That‚Äôs a heavy intake. Like a pack of cigarettes per day.

8 Zyns at 3mg = 24mg total, about 13mg absorbed ‚Äî still more than most people think. And again, it‚Äôs constant, slow absorption throughout the day. That's like half pack of cigarettes per day.


These pouches should be for situations where you can't vape or smoke, like during a long flight‚Äînot for everyday use. The steady nicotine delivery is just too much for the body over time.


I went back to vaping 9mg freebase juice at about 1.5ml per day. That‚Äôs roughly 13.5mg intake and only ~5mg absorbed (like 4 cigarettes). I feel way better now compared to when I was using only Zyns.

Zyns, pouches, and snus aren‚Äôt the ""safest"" nicotine options. Honestly, vaping is obviously the least harmful method overall.

Interesting thing I noticed. The first time I caught covid(didn't long haul that time), I had a cigarette on day 4 of my symptoms and felt instant relief from the sob and general flu symptoms.

AdCritical5383,2024-12-15 10:42:55,WSJ: ‚ÄúYoung Wall Street bankers say they have a drug problem with ADHD pills‚Äù,"
ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°

Many Wall Street bankers use Adderall and Vyvanse as tools to plow through long hours of tedious work amid high-pressure competition.

[https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/young-banker-finance-adhd-medication-adderall-d578a16f](https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/young-banker-finance-adhd-medication-adderall-d578a16f)

As Mark Moran was facing another 90-hour week as an investment-banking intern at Credit Suisse in New York, he knew he needed help to survive the rest of the summer. His colleagues gave him a tip: Visit a Wall Street health clinic and tell the staff he had trouble focusing.

Ahead of his first appointment, he filled out a five-minute questionnaire. One of the questions asked if he had trouble staying organized, another, if he procrastinated. He then met with a clinician who said his answers suggested he had attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. He left with a prescription for Adderall.

No matter that a family member, a psychologist, didn‚Äôt think Moran had ADHD. He found that when he took Adderall, he could keep working for hours, and was able to actually be interested in some of the mundane tasks required of a young investment banker, such as aligning corporate logos on a PowerPoint or formatting cells in Microsoft Excel. 

He also wanted to show his bosses he was a hard worker and eventually secure a lucrative full-time job offer after finishing graduate school.

‚ÄúThey gave me a script, and within months, I was hooked,‚Äù said Moran, now 33 years old and running his own investor-relations firm. He‚Äôs also a provocative personality on social media, commenting on finance, politics and culture, including prescription drug use. ‚ÄúYou become dependent on it to work.‚Äù

Images of Wall Street‚Äôs rank-and-file blowing cash on illegal drugs and nightlife are well known, with cocaine a favored drug through the 1980s, as portrayed in ‚ÄúThe Wolf of Wall Street.‚Äù 

These days, drugs are more a tool to optimize performance on the job. Especially for entry-level bankers at the analyst and associate level‚Äîwho work long, tedious hours and fiercely compete for higher-level jobs with big pay days‚Äîprescriptions for stimulants such as Adderall and other ADHD drugs have become commonplace.  

Jonah Frey, who worked as an investment banker in healthcare for Wells Fargo in San Francisco, said one colleague would sometimes snort lines of crushed up Adderall pills from his desk in the bullpen‚Äîthe common area where junior bankers sit and work together. ‚ÄúNobody blinked an eye,‚Äù he said.

Others use nicotine pouches such as Zyn to excess, or consume energy drinks. One banker who worked in Houston between 2017 and 2019 described his colleagues drinking ‚ÄúMonsterbombs‚Äù‚Äîan extra-strength 5-hour Energy shot dropped into a glass filled with Monster Energy, chugged in one go. The caffeine payload was the equivalent of nearly five cups of coffee at once.

The feeling that the jobs can‚Äôt be done without stimulants comes as Wall Street is under fire for pushing junior bankers to take on dangerous workloads.

Mundane-Option5559,2024-03-02 12:25:40,Philip Morris Faces Lawsuit Over Zyn Oral Nicotine Pouches (Ticker: PM),"(Bloomberg) -- The tobacco industry‚Äôs next big hope for a less-harmful nicotine product, the oral nicotine pouch, just received its first major legal challenge in a lawsuit that says Philip Morris International‚Äôs Zyn product is addictive and harmful to young people.

  
The lawsuit says that the pouches deliver more nicotine than cigarettes, and that Philip Morris benefits from ‚ÄúZynfluencers‚Äù who promote the brand on social media, with an estimated 30,000 TikTok accounts that use the hashtag #Zyn.

  
The single plaintiff, Bailey Wolters, alleges addiction and dental issues as a result of his Zyn use. The suit, seeking class-action status, also names as a defendant Stockholm-based Swedish Match, which made the pouches before a Philip Morris affiliate bought it for $16 billion in 2022.

  
The companies failed to warn about the risk of addiction and other harmful effects like cognitive issues, cardiovascular injuries, gastrointestinal problems and gum disease, the lawsuit says. It cites a study showing that Zyn is gaining popularity with teens because of marketing, and others that say nicotine use in adolescence has lasting adverse consequences for brain development.

  
Philip Morris didn‚Äôt immediately return a message seeking comment. The Stamford, Connecticut-based company said in a recent email exchange regarding Zyn that its products ‚Äúare not for those who don‚Äôt already use nicotine products, and never for those below the legal age of purchase.‚Äù

  
Zyn has become something of a conservative cause celebre in the US in recent months, with Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia calling for a ‚ÄúZynsurrection‚Äù after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York pushed for a federal investigation of the product‚Äôs marketing. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson has praised Zyn effusively.

  
The case was brought by the law firm, Schlesinger Law Offices PA, whose initial lawsuit against Juul Labs investors including Altria Group Inc. expanded into thousands of legal actions and led to Altria‚Äôs eventual settlement of $235 million.

MMKK6,2024-11-26 07:53:49,"Revamped US nicotine pouch tier list (Zyn, Lucy, On!, Zone, Rogue, Velo, Oxbar)","This is a revamp of my tier list of US nicotine pouches from a couple months ago. I‚Äôve tried some other European brands, but I‚Äôm going to keep it to the US versions of pouches.

##S Tier: Zyn
Zyn leads the pack for US users. The standout feature is how hard their 6mg pouches hit comparable to other brands‚Äô higher mg options. While the flavors are just okay, the buzz and dry pouch design make up for it. The flavorless option is a hidden gem. Zyn‚Äôs consistency and reliability make it the best option.

##A Tier: Lucy (High A, Previously S)
Lucy still offers some of the best flavors Apple Ice remains a personal favorite, but the appeal of their regular pouches has faded. I used to like the regular pouches more than the breakers but the breakers have become the highlight. The bursts of flavor that last for hours and feel more satisfying. The regular pouches, even at 12mg, don‚Äôt seem as strong anymore, possibly due to tolerance. Comfort wise, Lucy‚Äôs soft pouches are still among the best, and flavors like Mango Breakers, Apple Cider Breakers, and Espresso are top-notch. Nostalgia keeps Wintergreen in the mix, but it‚Äôs not a go to. Lucy‚Äôs still great, but not the game changer it once was.

##B Tier: On! (Low B, Previously A)
On! has dropped in quality, with sharp, cheap-feeling pouches that are uncomfortable on the gums. The flavors, while decent, no longer stand out. Coffee is still one of the best nicotine pouch flavors on the market, and Mint is refreshing, but Citrus is forgettable. On! works as a budget option but doesn‚Äôt feel special anymore.

##B Tier: Zone
Zone is consistent but unimpressive. The nicotine strength is underwhelming, and the flavors lean too sweet and artificial. However, the pouches are very comfortable, and Dragonfruit is a standout flavor. Zone is solid for casual use, but it doesn‚Äôt excel in any particular area.

##C Tier: Rogue
Rogue has great, long lasting flavors and I like the Wintergreen, with Policorex giving it a slow nicotine release. Unfortunately, the pouches irritate gums and lips despite feeling soft initially. The flavor strength is a redeeming quality, but the discomfort keeps Rogue firmly in C tier.

##C Tier: Velo (US Version)
Velo has improved, with fewer burst pouches and better overall quality. Dragonfruit stands out, but most other flavors are forgettable. The US version is decent, but it still doesn‚Äôt compare to the highly-praised EU version. A good choice in a pinch, but not exceptional.

##D Tier: Oxbar
Oxbar‚Äôs bold, vape like flavors, especially Peach Blue Razz Mint, are unique and memorable. However, the harsh burn on the gums prevents it from being a favorite. The flavor quality has improved since release, but the discomfort keeps it from rising above D tier. This are actually prerelease I got from a smoke shop that‚Äôs a front for a major wholesale site. It says ‚Äúsample not for sale‚Äù on it and the only information I can find on it is a 2Firsts website from a Dubai vape convention as a demo.

Favorite Flavors Recap
* Zyn: Flavorless, Cinnamon, Menthol
* Lucy: Apple Ice, Mango Breakers, Apple Cider Breakers, Espresso
* On!: Coffee, Mint
* Zone: Dragonfruit
* Velo: Dragonfruit
* Rogue: Wintergreen
* Oxbar: Peach Blue Razz Mint

Kitkatcandycorn,2025-05-08 12:44:28,Did I accidentally aspirate a zyn pouch?,"This morning after I woke up I (32M, former smoker) put a zyn pouch in when I went to let the dog out. After that I starting doing some chores for the day and after about an hour while I was doing the dishes I had a bit of a sneezing fit (which happens to me every time I start sneezing). A few minutes later I realized I didn't have my zyn pouch in anymore and I can't remember whether I had spit out or not. So I started coughing to see if I could get the potentially aspirated pouch out but now I've forced myself to cough so much I have developed some mild chest discomfort. Is it possible I accidentally aspirated the zyn pouch without realizing it or am I over reacting due to anxiety over it? I have recently quit smoking so mild chest discomfort over coughing isn't a new thing for me and my anxiety is sky high that I may have really screwed up by inhaling a zyn pouch.",0,AskDocs,1,zyn pouches,43

No_Ambition9394,2025-05-27 13:26:31,Using zyn to lose weight/trying zero nicotine pouches,"Hi everyone. Sooo I‚Äôve always loved a little nicotine in my life. Started out as  an occasional drunk cig at a party in college and then I didn‚Äôt touch nicotine after graduating for around 3 years. Then I took up drunk cigs again, and then vaping, and finally 2 years ago I tried Zyns and I never looked back. I‚Äôve quit a few times here and there and after a few months, I‚Äôll start back up again. I have Hashimotos and hypothyroidism and weight gain is inevitable for me, especially during flare ups. So recently I‚Äôve been working out more and finally getting some weight off, and aside from the minor appetite suppressant I feel from the Zyns, I think what really helps me as whenever I‚Äôm craving a snack, I just pop a Zyn in and by the time the flavor is gone I don‚Äôt want the snack any longer. It has really really helped me cut down on my cravings. BUT my addiction is getting out of control (in my mind) I‚Äôm going through 1 can of 3mg every two days, and I would like to quit. 

Has anyone else tried the zero nicotine pouches out there? I want to still be able to pop a pouch in my mouth when I‚Äôm having cravings, and so far nothing works like the Zyns. I‚Äôve tried mints, gum, tic tacs, etc. 

Or if anyone else has any suggestions for me on how to handle the food cravings once I do quit for good that would be great too! I‚Äôve experienced that side effect first hand and I‚Äôve always ended up packing on 5-10 lbs while quitting.

As you can see from the title I for diagnosed with gastritis back in December 24, after 7 months on Zyn.

I had rly bad nausea and a really fast heart when digesting food. Really bad time for me. 

I got put on 40mg of Nexium for 2 weeks and then when I got my endoscopy I got put on 6 weeks of Nexium. I am supposedly ‚Äúhealed‚Äù which is what the doctor said, it takes 6 weeks for an oesophagus to heal, but I do sometimes get really bad days.

I keep a diary of every day and what I eat. And this month I actually had an entire week of bliss, no issues at all! And then today I‚Äôm just feeling at a total loss. Terrible dysphasia and exhausted after eating. Also a lot of anxiety while eating. Does anyone know if these peaks and troughs are normal? Does it really only take 6 weeks to heal? 

I have an appointment in April to check up on me, I assume just a doctor asking me how I‚Äôve been, but what can they do for me? Has anyone experienced this? I‚Äôm feeling at a total loss, I feel so defeated as I keep thinking it‚Äôs finally gone, it‚Äôs finally gone, and then it comes back.

To illustrate, in pouch dreams as I like to call them, I can absolutely control what I want to do and where I want to go. I'm still in the fucked up dream world, but I have more conscious thoughts there. And of course the entire thing feels more vivid. I would say it's on par with a lucid dream -- I've brought back pieces of knowledge, text I've seen written down, and even a song that just blew my mind how clear it sounded. When I woke up, I went around the house and asked if anyone was playing music. Nope, I dreamed that. 

But pouch dreams are a beast to be tamed. I've had my fair share of scary pouch dreams. I got shot in one and I could feel it! Luckily I was able to wake myself up (another interesting feature of these dreams, I know I'm dreaming, and if it's fun, I continue on in dream world to explore) and not have to dream of being shot anymore lol. It felt almost exactly how I would imagine it. 

Though these dreams aren't for the weak, they're surely worth a try for anyone who has wanted a cheap and relatively safe way to explore lucid dreaming. I've never swallowed one of these things by the way. And my mouth does taste gross when I wake up. Maybe try doing patches if you're not into that. 

I'm just a sleepy type of guy so I tend to pass out without noticing once the sun goes down, I am OUT. And I'll pass out with a damn pouch In My Mouth",2,Dreams,5,zyn pouches,110

Amanroth87,2025-01-13 11:03:48,Experiences with Zonnic/Zyn nicotine pouches,"First let me say that I quit smoking about 5 years ago. I originally posted to this sub 4 years ago, celebrating 8 months without a cigarette. In that 5 years, I have tried on two occasions to smoke. I think I smoked about half a cigarette the one time, and the second time I puked after my first puff. These were both during times of peak stress in my life. Haven't touched one since, and I count myself very lucky to have made it this far. I want to thank you all for your tremendous support in what was a difficult time in my life, and I'm sure that I'll never smoke again even though I've been tempted to light up at other occasions.

About a year ago, Zonnic flavored nicotine pouches became available at convenience stores across my country. Now, I've had my experiences with vaping... I got rid of my vapes when I quit smoking entirely, but occasionally I will take a puff of one when I'm visiting with someone who uses them so you can't consider me entirely nicotine-free. However, when these pouches became readily available, I jumped on the bandwagon because I was curious to try them. Big mistake. They market them as an NRT, but I'd say they are more of a method to target new users who don't wish to have bad breath and stinky clothes.

Since then, they've removed them from stores and now sell them exclusively in pharmacies which I think was probably a good idea. I go to concerts and I see them littered in the garbage cans and urinals, and there have been times where the entire stock of a store or pharmacy is depleted so I assume they are reasonably popular. For me what was originally just a mild curiosity in the product has become an addiction... I put a fresh one in my mouth hourly, from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep. I seem to have withdrawals during the night, causing me to have weird and vivid dreams where I usually wake up in a cold sweat. I want to stop, but I find myself picking them up every time I run low. I've noticed that my gum lines appear to be receding in the areas in my mouth where I put them, and I'm genuinely afraid of the withdrawal process that I'm going to go through when I take the plunge and give them up entirely.

Any advice, or experiences to share regarding these Hell pouches? This community encouraged me once before, I'm hoping to find the strength to quit again.",3,stopsmoking,1,zyn pouches,113

ilikedeh,2025-03-03 01:06:47,My first use of Velo (nicotine pouches),"Yesterday being Sunday- a chilled afternoon- discussions about drugs came up. I've only ever used alcohol(not often), weed (less often) and moly (tried it once). Nothing outside that. I mention that I'd like to try at least every drug once in my lifetime; hence the decision to start with nicotine pouches. 

We go get some and I'm kinda excited to try one. I pop one in when we get back to the house and it takes a few tries to get it to sit right at the base behind my bottom lip. Felt so badass at this point lol. A few minutes in, ai, nothing. So I start throwing shade at the hype when my mouth starts to taste something... finally. Now listen, it went downhill from here. 

Kidogo kidogo, my buccal cavity (and throat) start to feel dry. I drink water but it's like I'm making it worse. This was closely followed by me feeling gassy. Wewe! Wacha nianze kunyamba nyamba (hahaha lol). But guess what? I still don't feel the high... until... I bent over to pick something and it hit me with a blow. 

I start feeling a very strange head rush, a lot of heat so I undress and the palpitations were crazy. Removed the pouch when I started feeling nauseous - I did vomit shortly after. Came back to the sitting area saying I feel better only for me to rush to the washroom again because this time my rectum felt like it was about to explode with poop. 

My body feels better but I'm still high and uncomfortable (I can relate the discomfort to how motion sickness feels like). In an effort to undo the high, I try to chugg a lot of water, heck I even tried to dance like I was in the club (this made it worse), I tried to sleep but the nausea!  Tried to cook because maybe food will help but I couldn't stand the smell. Eventually I just sat there in defeat as I waited for my body to self regulate back to the norm.

dispensieve,2025-02-20 19:28:22,I've just decided to stop Velo (pls I hope all my health issues are caused by nicotine pouches),"Disclaimer: English is not my first languageüòÅ

Hello quitters! 
I know there are already many stories like mine in this thread but I just really need to write it all down and get it off my chest.

I smoked cigarettes for ten years. When I was 26 I finally quit smoking but only so I could get addicted to nicotine pouches, yayy. I've been using them for about a year now, 7-10 per day (11mg of nicotine/pouch). 

Two months ago I had super annoying 10 days, I suddenly felt dizzy all the time, exhausted but what was worse, I had headache every single day, every morning I woke up with a headache, over the counter painkillers wouldn't help and the last day I had such terrible migraine (I don't suffer from migraines) I called my doctor and she sent me a prescription for migraine pills and stronger painkillers and headaches finally went away. 
But my troubles barely started. Since then I developed tinnitus, it was very quite in the beginning so I ignored it, I still felt dizzy though, vertigo, brain fog and some other weird symptoms like muscle twitching, sudden rapid heartbeat increase and sweating for no reason, nausea, blurred vision, not feeling hunger at all vs being hungry all the time (probably linked to nausea and digestion)
I went to several doctors only to find out my ears are okay, my brain is okay, my arteries are okay, everything with my body is okay, I'm just perfectly healthy woman. I tried literally everything I could, spent hours online googling my symptoms trying to find out what the hell could be causing all this. 
I have diagnosed depression and BPD and use ADs for 7 years. Recently I had my sertraline dose increased to max daily dose which was one of things that I thought might have caused my symptoms. Though I'm back at my original lower dose for three weeks now and not a single thing changed. 
Mostly that f-ing tinnitus and dizziness is driving me insane, my anxiety rises, I'm running out of strength and out of hope. I know people learn how to live with tinnitus but that stupid vertigo, low concentration and brain fog, that's what troubles me the most as I'm a taxi driver and now I can't drive because of this, I don't feel good and safe while driving. 
So doctors found nothing, ADs probably aren't the cause either, I started to take vitamins regularly, exercise daily (cervical spine mostly), meditate, reduced caffeine, just trying to do everything possible. 

And the very last thing in my life that might be causing my symptoms is the only thing I haven't thought of until today. 
My tinnitus is usually better for a little while in the morning, right after I wake up and before i get up. Yeah but I take Velo like three minutes after opening my eyes so it kinda makes sense. 
When I look back it fits (yeah my pessimistic side is telling that high dose of sertraline fitted as well) but I can't give up on this last bit of hope or I'll have nothing else left. All this time I was trying to find out what's wrong with me and I didn't even think of nicotine? Omg, I suspected caffeine, antidepressants, some hypothetical deadly disease and didn't think nicotine might have some negative effects on my health? My brain fog is definitely fogging damn hardüòÅ 

Guys, for the first time in these 11 years of using nicotine I feel a real urge to stop. Until today I never felt like quitting, I didn't even want to, didn't try to, I loved it, both cigarettes and the pouches. It helped me a lot while quitting alcohol and with anxiety. But it ends here! 
If anyone finished this stream of my late thoughts (damn it's 4am) I thank you for your attention and I wish you all including me all the best, lot of strength and much love üíï ",10,QuittingZyn,3,velo pouches,119
mrtyrd,2025-04-15 02:41:21,Velo nicotine pouches being given out at Temple Meads,"I was concerned today to see representatives for ‚ÄúVelo‚Äù giving out free nicotine pouches at Bristol Temple Meads. They seemed to be particularly targetting students and young people passing through the station. 

I‚Äôm aware that these products are currently not regulated in the UK like vapes / tobacco, but health research groups are have flagged growing concerns around the targeting of young people to what is an addictive product, with limited data available on the long term health impacts.

Understand these pouches are in theory less harmful than smoking / vaping and if people want to spend their money on them then it‚Äôs their call, but it seems to fly in the face of public health policy that it‚Äôs ok to actively target young people to take up addictive substances from inside the rail station (presumably with significant cash going to GWR for the privilege).

Anyone with more awareness on these issues thoughts would be very welcome and if anyone could advise of appropriate routes raise a concern to the council that would be great!

In 2021, I got into nicotine pouches. I am originally from Scandinavia, and snus aka the Zyn‚Äôs of Scandinavia are HUGE back home. However, I didn‚Äôt start using them until I started college in the USA. In 2021 my friends pressured me to try one, and since that day I have been addicted. I am talking about one can of pouches a day, at least 7mgs. My way of trying to quit in the past has been going from the european pouches (13mg) to 6mg Zyns, but I just keep staying on Zyns. I always tell myself I‚Äôll quit but I fail every time.

Now, I notice I have actual serious issues. I have heart palpitations, trouble breathing, increased heart rate and blood pressure. I am so scared for my health I HAVE TO quit. I am on day 2 of trying to go cold turkey but I feel like shit. I want to relapse and just do one more but I know it‚Äôs not just going to be one. I see myself trying to find the old used ones just have something under my lip and honestly it‚Äôs embarassing. I am embarassed that I‚Äôve led myself to become this addicted. It‚Äôs ridicilous.  
I desperately need support and encouragement. I feel so alone with this, especially because I dont have anyone to talk to about this. This habbit is just an embarassing for me, and I want to be set free so badly. The worst part is that I don‚Äôt actually want to use nicotine anymore. The addicition controls me.

**Commonly Asked Questions** 

- **What does this mean?** - *This means if you order these there is a risk you may not receive your order.*

- **How do products get added to the red list?** - *It's random, nobody knows.*

- **I'm using X product sold in the US, but that name is on the red list, how?** - *Products like Velo, General, White Fox, and others are sold in the US.  These aren't on the red list.  Only their European version that is imported.*

Specific Red List Links:  [Here](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_1163.html), and [here](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_1169.html).  And here's the [master list for Sweden](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/country_SE.html).

[More info and reasoning on this via this Snubie.com article](https://chadizzy1.blogspot.com/2024/12/fda-red-list-updated-22-december-2024.html).

---------

**Regarding shipping times to the US**

Here is some info about shipping to the US.

1.  In the old days, most stores processed orders within 24 hours.  At most, some would take 48 hours to process an order.  Now, it‚Äôs not unheard of for the two remaining stores to take many, many days to process an order.
2.  Once the order is out of the stores hands, the speed of shipping is not under their control.  This goes for every e-store that ships to the US.
3.  Clearance times are controlled by the FDA / UPS and the store has nothing to do with these.
4.  Clearance is normal.  Warehouse scans are normal.  Location scans are normal.  
5.  The speed that clearance happens is random.  Also, the store has no control over this.
6.  The speed in which you get your delivery is random.  The store also has no control over this.
7.  Orders can get to you in as quick as 2 days, or can take much longer.  A few weeks, or even up to a month or two.  Again, the stores have no control over this, it is entirely up to UPS / FDA.
8.  You may be charged extra duty on delivery, [here is info about that](https://old.reddit.com/r/Snus/comments/1kkx8um/info_buying_online_cost_effectiveness_with_duties/?).

---------

**Stores Shipping To The US**

NOTE:  Snus sales are not banned to the US.  Some products are on the ""Red List"", but many are not.  Some stores have decided to stop selling to the US, but that is the store's choice, not an official act or ban from the US against import (at this time).

- Shipping Snus to the US:  [SnusPort.com](http://www.SnusPort.com), [SwedishProducts.online (NOTE:  may incur duty fees](http://www.SwedishProducts.online), [MrSnuff.com](http://www.MrSnuff.com).

- Not Currently Shipping Snus to the US:  BuySnus.com, MySnus.com, Snus24.com, Snus.us, SnusCENTRAL.com, SnusDaddy.com, SnusDirect.com, SnusExpress.com, SnusRoom.com, SnusLine.com, SnusMe.com (many of these are shipping nicotine pouches to the US, but not snus)

---------

**If you order Red List products, it is at your own risk!**

1.  The [Red List](https://old.reddit.com/r/Snus/comments/1hssf01/us_shipping_fda_red_list_available_stores_and_ups/) is available, on this sub.  I keep it updated anytime a product is added.
2.  If you order a Red List product, it may get through, it may not.  You order these products at your own risk.
3.  It is not the fault of any e-store if they don't get through, are returned, or are destroyed.
4.  We advise you not to complain to the store, or try to do a chargeback, because this may lead to the last store shipping snus to us to stop completely.

---------

**Should I do a chargeback on my order?**

We have four remaining stores shipping snus to the US. We do NOT want to make them angry. If you are doing chargebacks on your orders, they may decide it isn't worth the risk to ship to us anymore and we won't be able to get snus.  **Ordering in 2025 is at your own risk!**  Making a snus order online, this is a risk we all have to assume. We may get our stuff. We may not. We may get all of our order. We may not. Red-list stuff is also at your own risk - you may get it, you may not. You may not get your entire order. It's up in the air. But don't make the last four stores regret shipping to us and completely pull from the US market.",62,Snus,128,velo pouches,195

GimmeThatHotGoss,2024-03-10 19:02:07,Talk about Zyn's - and tobacco marketing on youtube.,"So, I noticed the Zyn's have become a bit of a meme on the show - and I just want to point out that there is no such thing as harmless nicotine - and no such thing as harmless nicotine advertising. 
I work with a large anti-tobacco campaign in the united states, and we've been working with them to monitor tobacco advertising on social media that targets kids -- this has evolved from cigarettes to vaping (juul), to heated tobacco (iQos), and now pouches / snus (Zyn's). So many podcasts (shulz, kreisher, rogan) are promoting the product without disclosing their financial relationship and sponsorship - and all of those podcasts have young audiences who can't legally buy cigarettes. (PS. Tobacco Advertising is Not Allowed on all Major Social Media Platforms). 

So, when i see Andrew Shulz bullying his guests to try them, call them pussies if they don't - it hits different. I know what's behind that, and I know the effect that's going to have on a young audience. 

Big Tobacco has always targeted ""new customers"" and know from research that lifelong nicotine addiction starts at a young age - because you are less likely to get addicted later in life or pick up the habit. They need smoking to be cool, vaping to be cool, snus to be cool. They need you to be a pussy if you don't do it.

Right now, there isn't enough research about SNUS and lifelong addiction or the ""Gateway"" effect. However, what we DO know about vaping and addiction may also be true about snus. 

""Evidence does indicate that young non-smokers who use e-cigarettes, also a nicotine product, are 3x more likely to progress to conventional cigarette use compared to non-smokers that do not use e-cigarettes.""

""Teens who start vaping are nearly three times more likely to go on to smoke cigarettes than their peers who don‚Äôt use any type of tobacco product, a new study finds.""

We track the use of social influencers globally using social listening and research software, and publish reports about how tobacco companies violate laws, platform rules, and WHO standards on tobacco advertising - they do this all the time - because enforcement is limited. We were part of the team whose research was used to pressure Philip Morris into admitting they were doing this back in 2019 - https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1SH02K/ 

And here they all are, doing it again with pouches, moving the needles until the next round of restrictions and public health policies are put in place. With their astro-turk campaigns like: PMI's ""Smoke Free Future"" or BAT's VELO marketing:

From podcasts, to music festivals, to F1, to every ""GRWM"" tik-tok influencer stuffing their iQoS into their purse. They can't traditionally advertise Joe Camel, so this is where those billions have moved. 

""According to reports by The Guardian, BAT has invested ¬£1bn on marketing campaigns that harness the appeal of influencers, music stars and sporting events to market Velo, the company‚Äôs nicotine pouch product.""

https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/what-we-do/global/nicotine-pouches

And don't get it twisted - because these same companies are happily flogging the traditional cigarettes in emerging economies - where the same legal frameworks don't exist to restrict their marketing or product sales through taxes - they aren't pushing a ""smokeless future"" there. 

I just thought I'd raise this, as the meme goes, because using SNUS on the podcast, and memeing about it, making it a casual thing is exactly what these predatory, murderous corporations want.",719,h3h3productions,41,velo pouches,203

Pacmyne,2023-06-07 19:27:41,[WTS] Peasant/Bullet Bags - Copenhagen/velo Molle Pouch - HK Hook Gryphon Claws,"Timestamp: https://imgur.com/a/4IbP3ed

Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/LIStYxd

Copenhagen/Zyn Molle pouch is my new pouches releasing tonight. Pretty self explanatory here just a small pouch perfect for a can of dip or anything small you want to store on a piece of Molle gear. Throw it on your belt, pack, or chest rig. Also available with hook and loop on the back instead of the Molle attachment. Available in every color that the bullet bags are. Until I get faster at making them they are starting at **~~$30 shipped~~** **$25 shipped** but hopefully I can get faster and lower that price they are time consuming.

1x MC Black but more on the way!!

Another newer version of the Bullet Bags! Inspired by another custom order request from my friends over at AK Peasants. New design has a loop of webbing creating a handle for easy control when moving down the firing range. Also new patches to go with! 2x4 inch field of loop for the bigger square patches. 1.5x3 inch for the smaller patches. Offering 2 sizes for handguns and rifle caliber bullets. Little guy holds atleast 200 bullets and could hold more but not certain how much more weight it can hold I haven‚Äôt tested more than 200 9mm rounds. I double stitched every seam and triple stitched on some so it should hold a good heavy load but not tested much. The blue digital is very thin material and definitely not intended for a lot of weight mostly for looks and to hold lighter gear. Available in Multicam Black, Woodland, MC Tropic, Ranger Green, Coyote, Flecktarn, Alpine Snow, Realtree Camo, Blue Digital, Scorpion Ocp and Black. Vietnam Tiger Stripe will be back in at the end of the week. Currently only have the 7 patch variations shown in the picture 9mm, 556, 223, 7.62x39, and ''Freedom Seeds''. Each bag will come with one patch of your choice. Any extra patches will be an additional $4. Making these daily so let me know what you would like to see in the next post if it‚Äôs not in this one. 
**$30 shipped for smaller pouch**
**$35 shipped for larger pouch**
Specify which size patch and variation of patch. Also which size bag and type of handle or D rings at the end.

x2 Large Flecktarn
x3 small MC Tropic
x1 small Alpine Snow
x1 small flecktarn
x1 Large Blue Digital
x1 1 small Realtree Camo

‚ÄãHK hook belt clip lanyards to hang your keys, gloves, or any other tacticool gear you can think of. The belt clips wrap around your belt and velcro onto itself. They can be weaved through Molle if you don‚Äôt want to wrap around your belt. I offer 2 sizes one for EDC belts that are up to 2 inches wide and don't hang as low. The Battle Belt clips fit belts up to 2.5 inches wide and hang about an inch lower. At the moment I have Coyote, Multicam Tropic and Arid, Black, Ranger Green, Woodland, Multicam Black, Hawaiian Sunset, Black Hawaiian, Black, and Blue Polynesian materials on hand. Currently have 1 of each color for the edc but plenty more materials and making more daily.
**EDC clip $15 shipped and $10 for each additional clip**
**Battle clip $17 shipped and $12 for each additional clip**
**First person to buy 4 or more belt clips gets a free 2 point quick adjust sling that I make!‚Äã‚Äã**

**Fire Sale right now!! 3 clips for $30 any size!!**

Can‚Äôt take preorders per page rules but comment what you would like to see in tomorrow‚Äôs post and I‚Äôll make sure to have it!

Direct-Detective2005,2025-01-24 16:17:27,3mg Zyn vs 9 mg Fre,"Why does a 3mg zyn feel stronger to me than a 9mg fre pouch?

Recently, zyn has been almost impossible to find where I live and it has been my go-to nicotine pouch ever since I stopped smoking when I discovered it for sale at a convenience store in 2017. Due to not being able to get my hands on a decent amount of zyn recently I decided to try some other brands, but for some reason I‚Äôm having trouble finding one that gives me a nicotine buzz that even feels close to what I‚Äôve experienced with Zyn. Out of curiosity I decided to try a few of the ‚Äúhigher strength‚Äù options but to my surprise I‚Äôve found that even a 9mg Fre pouch wasn‚Äôt able to provide a strong enough dose to satiate my nicotine requirements. Tried 8mg Lucy, still no. Tried 8mg 2One pouches, nope. The only one that has even come slightly close has been the new 6mg VELO Plus pouches. 

I‚Äôm confused. What‚Äôs the deal with pouch strength? Am I missing something? Are they lying about how much nic there is? How could a 3mg dry pouch feel so much more powerful than a 9mg moist pouch? Is it me? Do I have some kind of nicotine firewall installed in my brain that only lets Phillip Morris International through? ",3,NicotinePouch,4,2one pouches,212

I get pouches delivered by mail all the time - even just last week I got an order 2ONE pouches. Fortunately, I just sent it to my in-laws in Florida. But, I'm still confused. Does anyone know why?

MentalMarsupial24,2024-08-29 16:30:10,I need a new nic pouch recommendation.. preferably 7mg or higher.,"Daily drivers:
- 6mg Zyn coffee
- 7mg Velo dragon fruit(asspouches)
- 6mg Rogue spearmint
- 12mg whitefox blue 
- 8mg !On wintergreen

Been seeing Zone around my 711s but haven't tried them and I haven't tried a lot of Velo flavors. Any other cans I should keep a look out for? 

Edit: just got my hands on 2ONE 8mg citrus. 21 in a can and it was like 2 bucks from my closest gas station. Flavor is awesome. Moist pouches for sure. I don't get much of a BUZZ anymore but the nic was there. Satisfied my cravings for sure. Smells VERY pungent. Like orange or grapefruit peel. Would highly recommend if you like a fruity pouch.

calmatotal,2021-05-16 11:11:43,Origin of nicotine in nicotine pouches,"Hi everyone. 

Looking at Snubie's recent review of Niin Citrus Chill nicotine pouches, where the brand says ""they use  100% synthetic nicotine while other manufacturers use nicotine extracted from tobacco"", I was curious, because I thought all nicotine pouches used synthetic nicotine.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJhtZxFRRLg&t=363s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJhtZxFRRLg&t=363s)

Does anyone know which brands use which? I guess not, haha

My fav brands right now are Nordic Spirit, Skruf, Lift, Zyn mini dry and On!

I don't know how they will make the synthetic, then apart are the nicotine salts used in brands like Zyn mini or On !, how many questions, and curiosity haha",5,Snus,1,2one pouches,216
