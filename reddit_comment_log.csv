,2023-11-26 17:09:29,"My two cents: I always end up getting hooked. I’m currently on my third go around getting hooked and really wished I hadn’t picked up the habit. The effects of daily use set in for me around 6-8 weeks and they are rough (palpitations, tight chest, heightened anxiety, reduced pleasure in day to day activities, etc.). Quitting is pretty unpleasant as well. For me, using even just 2-3 months leads to pretty significant withdrawals.

That being said, if you can avoid becoming addicted, zyn/nic pouches can be very helpful for focus. Tread lightly if you do use them, addiction (even to a relatively innocuous substance) is quite burdensome and is just another thing to deal with.",30,1,0,zyn pouches,1

It didn't list brands, and I was curious/concerned, as I have been consuming Zyn for a couple years now. I found another study that found no TSNAs in Zyn specifically, which was a bit of a relief. Zyn seems to be higher quality than other brands of pouches.

I still am curious and concerned about any significant negative physiological effects from nicotine itself, but so far haven't found anything that concerns me enough to make me quit.

I don't think that nicotine helps with stress. If anything, the stimulant effects and highly addictive nature of it could end up causing some stress. But I do enjoy the mental focus effects of it. And let's be honest, I am addicted at this point, though for me the addiction seems to me mostly psychological. I have gone without for days at a time when I got sick (colds, COVID). When I get sick I don't want caffiene or anything else that's going to keep me from resting and sleeping as much as I need to.

Deer_reeder,2024-02-13 10:41:12,"Nicotine is harmful to the body in many ways. The problem is NOT just that it is addictive. 

Pouches, vaping, gum, lozenges…all nicotine is terribly harmful. Not just cigarettes!

I finally stopped using nicotine completely a year ago, when I had a bone fracture that would not heal. 

Nicotine drastically slows healing and can even prevent bone healing. Did you know that?? I didn’t.

Frustrated and in pain after 9 months of pain and suffering, despite treatment for a spinal fracture,I was considering surgery.  

I had truthfully answered “no” when asked if I smoked, but finally the bone specialist mentioned that it was odd I wasn’t healing, unless I was using nicotine. 

That information from the doctor stunned me.

I intermittently was vaping or chewing gum, not even heavily, just a little bit daily. 

Immediately I stopped using all nicotine and the fracture healed rapidly.

I share this story because I am so angry that the tobacco industry is pushing product so hard to people, very young people in particular. 

The line of bull is not refuted near enough:  Nicotine is relatively safe as long as it is not smoked. 

THAT IS A LIE. 
Categorically, nicotine is toxic, it is poison. Short term and long term use is absolutely detrimental to your health. 

The US should run a balls out campaign of the damage done to the cardiovascular system, the nervous system, and the musculoskeletal system, all that nicotine is culpable for.

It is appalling, the amount of googling and searching to find hard facts. Plenty of vague info about using products other than cigarettes, for the purpose of quitting cigarettes. You will read how these products are “relatively harmless” and you will see the cute packaging and notice how easy it is to use them without anyone knowing. The products are just as expensive as cigarettes are now and they are just as addictive. 

Yet, there are only mild warnings from government and medical sites. Often, there are paywalls to get to scientific facts and studies. For non-medical professionals, like me, reading and comprehending the facts is a challenge.

In other words, the industry has put a lot of $$$$$ into keeping us ignorant.

Obviously, funding should be provided by every company involved in the production, marketing, and sales of nicotine for human consumption.

I’ve been using Zyn for 7 years now and I’ve tried quitting before. But I had horrible insomnia, vivid ass dreams when I did fall asleep, and constipation. So I gave up.. My thing was I’d go in and buy 2 cans, then I’d also need an energy drink (the biggest monster with the lid), then I’d also need a coke….. and then maybe I should get a breakfast sandwich and a pack of m&m’s. Next thing you know I’ve spent $30-$40. Every 2 days. 

Unfortunately and fortunately, I bought a new truck with a higher payment than I wanted. Even though I can afford the vehicle, I’ve been crunching numbers to keep from eating up monthly savings. (Just freaking out for no reason in my head lol)

I added up all my gas station trips and it equated to way over the difference in me and my fiancées new vehicle payments vs our old ones. $389 is what I spent in August. I only put in 40 of gas. July and June I know were way higher.

Today was rough, but my fiancée made me a good breakfast and we did get Starbucks. Then I’ve been eating ring pops. I told my fiancée for some reason if I just had something to chew on I’d feel ok. Like a tooth pick or a straw. So we got up and got some packs of gum. Been drinking lots of water too so that helps.

Chemical_Raccoon_184,2025-03-10 08:29:58,"Nic pouches aren't that much safe as people rave about. I fell into the same scam trap of having lungs free of smoke/vapor but honestly I feel much better now that I am back to vaping than I was with zyns. Continuously absorbing huge amounts of nicotine via zyns left me with a nicotine intake much higher than my old smoking vaping days. 

Now my nic intake is like 75% less than when i was using pouches. 

People market it as the safest form of nicotine but it's not. It's not safe for the cardiovascular system at all. 

The safest form of nicotine is vaping. Everything else is too much and too unhealthy for the body. 

With zyns I was absorbing amounts of 1 pack of cigarettes or more per day, something that I never did before zyns. Zyns didnt do any good to me actually. 
But vaping is much better than smoking and the total nicotine intake is much lower. 

Zyn and nicotine pouches are a scam trap. People stupidly rave about lung free health but they never mention how it affects the cardiovascular system. 

Zyns are only for when you can't smoke or vape for like 10 hours so u put one in. Only one though. Not snusing all day long. This is even worse habit than smoking or vaping.

I realize that all people who rave about zyns and pouches and tobacco snus are edgy children. Even in Sweden most people vape and only a small percentage use snus or pouches. They source studies about how snus improved lung health but they never link a study of how it affects the cardiovascular system.

But in terms of harm tbh hard to tell, obviously there are tons of chemicals thar are not meant to be constantly inhaled, but in terms of cardio it’s extremely weird but i felt a bit better when i vaped compared to what i felt on nic pouches.

## Tafseer of the above-quoted verse

(2) The verse asks us to adopt a gentle tone and an open-hearted manner in speaking to others, whether they are good or evil, pious or impious, orthodox or aberrant, followers of Sunnah or adherents to partitive innovations in it. In religious matter, however, one should not try to hide the truth for the sake of pleasing people or of winning their approval. The Holy Qur'an tells us that when Allah sent Sayyidna Musa and Sayyidna Harun (Moses and Aaron) (علیہم السلام) to the Pharaoh فرعون ، He instructed them to use gentle and soft words (20:42). ___None of us who addresses another today can be superior to Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) ، nor can the man addressed be viler than the Pharaoh فرعون.___

Talha ibn 'Umar recounts that once he said to the great master of the Sciences of Exegesis and Hadith, 'At-a' عطاء ، ""One can see around you people who are not quite orthodox in their beliefs. As for me, I am rather short-tempered. If such people come to me, I deal with them harshly."" 'Ata' replied, ""Do not behave like this,"" and, reciting the present verse, he added, Allah has commanded us to speak to people politely. When Jews and Christians all are to be treated like this, would this commandment not apply to a Muslim, no matter what kind of a man he is?"" (Qurtubi)

SM is more than snus and nicotine pouches, as they also make moist snuff (Longhorn/Timberwolf via Pinkerton tobacco) chewing tobacco (~~Redman~~ America's best chew also via Pinkerton) and cigars (non-Cuban Macanudos among others) in the US market. This doesn't include holding a global market share dominance of supportive products like matches (various brands) and lighters (Cricket). This business empire was LONG established before the buyout in late 2022, so to say Phillip Morris played a role in their development or current standing isn't really the case.

I agree with others that originators (if not first to produce, then first to innovate) tend to dominate markets. Copenhagen snuff was first produced in 1822, and still holds 36% of all dip sales in the US market 203 years later making it the most sold dip brand.

provigil, dexedrine, vyvanse…. super normalized even in the mid-late 2010s

if this is news anywhere it’s more then it becoming common in asia too now where despite even worse office:life balance, stricter medication laws made it less prevalent. e.g. (cuz it’s what i know first and second hand) even in korea or china now everyone trying to get adderal or ritalin in particular or at least a generic methylphenidate (ritalin) or more easily prescribed alternatives like modafinil or strattera

haarp1,2024-12-15 13:52:29,"A Wall Street Journal investigation in August about Bank of America’s treatment of young bankers put a spotlight on long hours that violate its policies and cause health problems. One junior banker died in May after putting in over 100 hours a week for about a month to finish work on a $2 billion acquisition. After the article’s publication, Bank of America and the wider industry said they would crack down on overwork. Morgan Stanley, for example, now asks junior bankers to report their hours and will intervene in some cases to make sure they don’t go over 80 hours a week. 

Still, interviews with more than 50 current and former investment bankers at over a dozen banks about how they cope with long hours and high-pressure jobs made clear that the use of stimulants is openly discussed and visible in workplaces. 

Most banks mentioned in this article either declined to comment or didn’t respond to requests for comment. 

Broadly speaking, some banks said they were focused on improving working conditions for employees. Some said they viewed these examples as isolated cases and said employees made their own health decisions regarding prescription medication.

‘A very, very important tool’

Trevor Lunsford, a mergers-and-acquisitions banker for Ascend Capital in Washington, D.C., said he has taken Adderall for seven years. “It’s a very core, integral component of my life, and to me, something that is a very, very important tool,” he said.

He said that for a month he took a 6 a.m. flight to Denver early in the week, connecting through Detroit, to meet with clients of the bank. He would spend eight hours at a management presentation, then go to dinner for four hours after that.

“For a couple of days of the week, it was very regularly a 20-22 hour day,” he said. “That’s something that I would not have been able to be on for, be focused and be quick with decisions if I wasn’t able to take Adderall.”

Around 14 million people had prescriptions for ADHD medication at the end of 2022, up 26% from 2012, according to numbers provided to the Justice Department by pharmaceutical data firm Iqvia. Easier access to the drugs through online health services has driven a surge in new prescriptions, particularly among adults. First-time Adderall prescriptions increased 27% for people aged 30-44 in 2024 from 2021, according to medical insights firm Truveta.

Adderall and Vyvanse, another commonly prescribed ADHD drug, are classified as Schedule 2 drugs, on par with cocaine and opioids because of their high potential for abuse. Abuse can cause frenetic behavior and heart problems. 

Samuel Glazer, a New York psychiatrist who counsels high-powered bankers working on Wall Street, said the long-term effects of drugs such as Adderall haven’t been adequately studied, and that they can often be gateways to more dangerous substances. He said he has had clients come in after they tried to buy pills from drug dealers because they ran out of their monthly prescription.

He said the immense financial rewards of working on Wall Street—starting banker salaries can reach $200,000—can push people to use drugs to improve their performance, saying “the only way to work these hours is if you are really, really driven to perform.”

He said he worried that the destigmatization of amphetamines in a work setting will lead many to lifelong dependencies. “Many of my patients think about taking stimulants just like they would think about taking multivitamins or dietary supplements,” he said. “This is much more casual than opioids were 20 years ago.”

Boutique health clinics such as New York’s Trifecta Health, used by Moran, and the telehealth sites that boomed during the pandemic have eased access to ADHD drugs. 

Edward Fruitman, a psychiatrist who owns and operates Trifecta, said 50% of his clientele comes from Wall Street. He said they turn to him because they say their high-octane jobs are nearly impossible to do unassisted. “There is a limit to what any human being can really produce and do,” he said, adding that the difficulties at work could be a sign of untreated ADHD.

For ADHD patients, “I was trying to create a system that does not throw any other obstacles in the way of treatment,” he said. The doctor said the clinic sought to prevent stimulant abuse and looked for signs of drug seeking behavior.

Trifecta doesn’t take insurance. Patients pay $350 for an initial consultation and $240 every month thereafter. After the pandemic started, Trifecta began to offer telehealth services. (Fruitman also operates a plastic surgery business, offering Botox, filler and face-lifts, and has a psychiatric practice that includes addiction counseling.)

Moran visited the clinic from 2016 to 2019, spending over $5,000. He eventually switched drugs to Vyvanse instead of Adderall, and his prescription steadily increased to 70 milligrams a day. He said he was told it was normal to increase dosages as users developed a tolerance to the drug. At first he visited once a month to get his prescription refilled, but he said eventually he wasn’t required to.
During his final visit, a physician assistant offered to keep his prescription at 70 milligrams of Vyvanse—the maximum daily dosage of the drug—and add on 20 milligrams a day of Adderall. He didn’t agree to the new regimen, and stopped going to the clinic about a week later. 

By that time, he had a job at the boutique investment bank Centerview Partners in New York. He had stayed at the office preparing a pitch deck for a client until 5 a.m., went home to change clothes, then headed back to work at around 9 a.m. for a meeting with the client, taking Vyvanse on the way in. 

Later that morning, while tinkering with a financial model, he began having heart palpitations that felt like he had just sprinted an 800-meter race, “except I was on Microsoft Excel instead of the track.” 
“I knew that I needed to stop,” he said. 

Monthlong detox

Frey, the Wells Fargo banker, received an Adderall prescription from Teladoc, an online healthcare company, in 2020. 

He wanted to try it because some of his colleagues took the drug and had told him it helped them cope with the long hours. It wasn’t unusual to start some days in the San Francisco office at 4 a.m., to be awake for calls with the bank’s clients on the East Coast, and stop around 2 a.m. the next day. 

In 2021, he took a new job in New York at Leerink Partners, the former investment banking arm of Silicon Valley Bank, where he was working to build out a healthcare-focused team. 

On top of building complex financial models and 100-slide presentations to win key advisory roles for big mergers and acquisitions, he was working on business development and helping less-experienced analysts learn the job. “My workload went up at least two- or threefold, and that’s when things started to go south,” he said.

During his monthly appointments with Teladoc, he told clinicians he was working a lot more than in the past, and they offered to up his dosage. He agreed. 

“I started taking it once in the morning and then once in the afternoon, at first for five days a week, and then it became seven days a week because I was working most weekends,” he said. 

He began to lose track of what day of the week it was because the pills whipped him into a nonstop productive frenzy. He lost his appetite and dropped around 25 pounds. 

Finally, he quit the job in 2022 and stopped taking the drug.
He moved back in with his parents. It took about a month to feel normal again. He got cold sweats in the evening and would either sleep for 12 hours straight or not sleep at all. He tried to stay productive, including by learning French through the app Duolingo.
“I went in understanding the downside risks” of using Adderall, he said. “But the reward was making managing director and pulling in a seven-figure salary. I felt that I had to have an edge to make it.”
After stopping the drug, “I had to basically relearn the basics of how to operate as a human being in society, outside of the realm of just going to the office and working yourself to death,” he said. He enrolled in business school two months after he stopped taking the drug and now is back to work.

Zyn pyramids

Some bankers use nicotine pouches such as Zyn and energy drinks to power through tedious work, including building large financial models where one incorrectly typed equation can ruin an entire project, or spending hours pulling together obscure financial figures about private companies for prospective buyers.

The products are heavily used by young men and are touted by “bro” influencers on social media.",1,1,0,zyn pouches,10

haarp1,2024-12-15 13:52:35,"
Zyn, a product of Swedish Match, which is owned by Philip Morris International, comes in hockey-puck size containers of 15 pouches—a user places one between the lip and gum. Some bankers said they have seen colleagues use so many Zyn pouches in a day they ingest the same amount of nicotine as they would by smoking a pack of cigarettes or more. Empty containers are commonly stacked in pyramids around bullpens.

Some analysts in the Houston office of Jefferies were known to put two Zyn pouches in at a time while cranking out financial models and PowerPoint slide decks, according to three people who worked there. 
They said Zyn helped bankers cope with a major spike in hours this year, when they would work until 4 a.m. for days in a row on big deals, such as the $26 billion merger of Diamondback Energy and Endeavor Energy.  

The product often sells out online and in retail stores, including at shops near investment banks. In Manhattan, Smiler’s Deli across the street from Jefferies typically sells out of Zyn a few days after getting its twice-weekly shipment of nearly 100 containers, a cashier said. The store had a bag of competitor brands behind the counter to offer to customers who need a fix as it waited for its next delivery. 

Changed personality

Prescription medications are widely used to get through the long days on Wall Street.

One former banker said he started taking Adderall while working at Guggenheim Partners in New York between 2017 and 2019 after realizing that many others were on it. At the office, “there were pill bottles everywhere,” he said.

A banker at Wells Fargo said he takes 50 milligrams of Vyvanse each morning and 20 milligrams of Adderall some evenings. A typical starting dose is either 30 milligrams of Vyvanse or 5 milligrams of Adderall a day, according to Glazer. 

Because of an ongoing shortage of ADHD medications, the banker often struggles to find a pharmacy that can fill his prescription. He has a list of around 10 he tries each month. He said he realized he was addicted when he found himself sitting in traffic on a city bus in Queens, nearly an hour from his office, to get to a pharmacy that could fill his prescription. 

He also said he has felt himself become antisocial and isolated from using the medication over the years. 

He said the amphetamines hinder his ability to have casual conversations at work because he feels anxious and laser-focused on working. Instead of socializing, he exercises almost every night at a gym near his apartment or plays videogames by himself. 

He said he felt the drugs make him robotic and highly transactional, unable to entertain the idea of socializing with strangers—because he sees no immediate value-add.

One woman who worked in commodities finance in Boston found Adderall to be a miracle drug for the first year, giving her so much energy that she would work late into the night and stay at the office for 48 hours. She said that on the drug, she could focus on analyzing obscure trends in commodities markets and build complex forecasts of power prices for hours without needing a break.

She lost around 30 pounds and was rarely eating, but she was succeeding at work and decided not to think too much about it.

Over time, she said the drug altered her personality, making her overconfident and financially irresponsible. She would take short breaks at work to gamble with her savings by investing in penny stocks.

After nearly two years, she realized she depended on the drug to have the energy to do anything. She tried to quit cold turkey. She stopped going to work and started to lose thousands of dollars on her risky investments in penny stocks, but she didn’t sell off the bad bets because she felt no motivation to go anywhere or do anything.  
In 2021, she quit her job, sold off the stocks and moved to California for a time. She has struggled with depression and relapses since then.

Adderall is also widely bought as a street drug. But the risk is that counterfeit pills can be contaminated with fentanyl, an often deadly opioid. Two college students at Ohio State University died in 2022 after taking counterfeit Adderall pills that contained fentanyl. 

Glazer, the New York psychiatrist, said people who misuse stimulants are more prone to seek out other types of drugs.

Michael Bloom, 29, joined Royal Bank of Canada in New York in 2022, eager to prove himself after transferring into investment banking. His team worked on deals in the financial technology industry, and two people who worked on the team said it was known for long hours and high turnover. 

A superior pulled Bloom aside and voiced concern that he was using Adderall to manage his workload, a person close to Bloom said. Bloom told him he didn’t think it was an issue that he was taking the pills, and that he needed them to concentrate. 

On April 11, 2023, Bloom went home from the office around 7 p.m. and worked through the night from home, according to three people familiar with his schedule. One person on his team pinged him around 9 p.m. to see if he had more bandwidth to start working on a new project, and Bloom said he couldn’t because he was already too busy, one of the people said. He took another call around 3:30 a.m. from someone he worked with, two of the people said. 

His wife found him dead on the floor the next morning. An autopsy concluded he died accidentally from acute intoxication from the combined effects of fentanyl and ethanol. It couldn’t be learned how the fentanyl entered his system.

A spokeswoman for RBC said, “We remain extremely saddened by the loss of our colleague and friend. Our thoughts continue to be with his family.”",1,0,1,zyn pouches,10

I really don’t think they have a case here. The “harm” is that nicotine is addictive, which it says on every container. Nicotine by itself is otherwise safe. 

You could say that the sweeteners rotted your teeth but I think you could say that for any other candy. Chocolate also has addictive chemicals in it (like caffeine). This feels like a stretch.",4,0,1,zyn pouches,11

evilzombiefan,2024-03-02 13:56:13,"Let's at least admit that Juul knew what it was doing. A Tabacco company playing by the rules and not unofficially marketing to teenagers yeah ok I believe that. I can so hear the back-room discussions and country club discussions. These people only want profits they don't give a shit about who buys it only that they do buy it. So, let's take the oh they are not doing bad stuff out of the argument. I'll say it now they will lose the lawsuit if it's true which I'm going to believe is true. 

Tobacco company brand ambassador was like hey we could get kids on the socials to promote this shit because kids are dumb and will buy whatever their favorite influencers are hawking. Probably paid them some lowball numbers and they did it to make that money and were actually happy to be endorsed. Yeah, I see that happening exactly just like that.  Probably even gave them buzz words to use and phrases and wording to stay away from, they were coached basically.

Anyway, yeah this would be an opportune time to get some stock once it dips due to the publicity of the case but probably want to wait till the verdict possible. Going down if they lose, goes even or slightly up if they win. Not sure if the suit is settled out of course if so then stock probably stays its course.

People importing counterfeit pouches from producers in China.

Easy way to spot fakes are:

-Strong smell from pouches or unopened tin

-Bottom edges of the tins are sharp

-Labels are miscut or aren’t centred properly

-Labels have improper colour

-Tins are harder to break the seal on

  **Full text:** 
  Hello, I am 23 years old and haven’t been to a dentist in about 3 years since I’ve lived out of state. I have noticed my gums receeding and just wanted to ask and see if they look normal or if I possibly have some sort of gum disease? If anyone could give me more information I provided pictures as well thank you! Could possibly be from zyn pouches and smoking?

I can see some of that recession, as well as inflammed gums: that is minimum gingivitis. However, smokers TEND to be very susceptible to actual gum disease (periodontitis), a thorough assessment, full-mouth xray (panoramic), and clean will determine where you fall on the severity of that should you be at that stage

The thing is, a lot of these guys don’t even live anywhere near the South, yet they’ve fully committed to the aesthetic.

When I was growing up, that whole look was considered lame. Maybe it’s because millennials connected more with rap culture—at least, that was the case for me growing up in Atlanta, where it was just part of the culture. Even now, my style leans more toward skate, snowboard, surf, and streetwear, which makes sense since I live in a ski town and actually spend my time snowboarding and going on surf trips. So, at least I’m not out here pretending to be something I’m not.

But these Gen Z guys in my ski town? They’re rocking this Southern cosplay and, with it, adopting the politics that come with the look. It’s like they feel the need to back it up by leaning into certain ideologies. On top of that, I think a lot of Gen Z men struggle with dating and attraction, and instead of figuring it out, they just get bitter. If they can’t prove they’re “men” by getting laid, they try to prove it by punching down—and that attitude fits right into the GOP playbook.

In the past, men and women had far more non-intimate social interactions in various spheres and social spaces, with both acting a moderating influences on one another and exposing each other to differing ideas and worldviews

Men and women who leaned too far into behaving like a walking stereotype,, or embodied the worst traits associated with their gender, would generally face social rejection unless they evolved in some way.

Popped collar, upside-down visor. It started with movies like American pie in the late 90s but kept escalating with movies like eurotrip and the like where girls are just hot rewards to have sex with when they realize the slightly nerdy guy is smart and has feelings like other people. Grew up on ""and now, girls jumping on trampolines"" on the man show. 

""A key that opens any lock is a master key, a lock that can be opened by any key is a shitty lock"" was the reply for why women were sluts and men studs for when both had sex with a lot of people.

Feminism meant nothing more than girls should get equal rights and paid the same for the same job. No one had heard the term toxic masculinity or white privlage or anything like that. Young people were hyper A-pplitical in this era. The entire culture hated young girls openly and everything they liked. Boy bands were the lames dumbest thing ever. We encourages pick me behavior and ""not like other girls"" behavior. ""You don't like twilight like all the dumb bitches right? Let me explain how fight club is the best movie to ever exist."" 

The list goes on forever. Every generation of young men goes thru it somewhat, but I'd say 2004-09 was the peak of this behavior ever at the start of the internet age while millennials were becoming young adults.

The big difference today is that Gen Z bro culture is commercialized and centered around social media influencers. While previous generations of Bros were formed organically.

I don't want to be unsympathetic to the challenges they face and I am aware there is a cost of living issue, but they aren't more cooked than, day, millennials who graduated in the Great Recession. No jobs, engineers competing for jobs at Burger King and honestly, things weren't that much cheaper than they are now. I did a cost compare to my old apartments (graduated into that lovely economy) and while they did cost slightly less, wages have also gone up since then. 


Are there challenges? Yes, it's not all perfect, but I'm somewhat tired of hearing about them as some unprecedented event. Gen Z has the same options of scrimping and saving as we did and can definitely just do broke dates like we did when we were dating and poor. Some of us even ended up married. The fact that Gen Z sees themselves as ""cooked"" when under the same circumstances as us seems to have more to do with their mindset and proclivities, which to be fair isn't entirely their fault (they didn't invent the social media that raised them), but doesn't make it more accurate. ",4,0,1,zyn pouches,40

They didn’t “relate” to Democrats, didn’t feel like Democrats or the Left in general actually “gave a damn” about them. The Left focused more on “specific minority groups like the LGBTQ instead of the average, everyday American”

These are direct quotes I got from my friends after a previous conversation over text. It seems pretty obvious, Trump and Conservatives managed to pander to white guys who think of themselves as everyday people, and Kamala and Democrats didn’t. It doesn’t matter that Trump doesn’t give a fuck about the people, I guess he just managed to make it *seem* like he did. 

I know that for the past few years, really since the 2010’s, men in general have felt shamed, belittled, and mocked by Left-leaning individuals. Especially if you’re not college educated, or are just blue collar. The amount of videos, statements, and memes I’ve seen calling Right-wing folks outright “dumb,” or “stupid,” kinda indicates a feeling of elitism from the Left. Perhaps this election was a reaction to that feeling of being insulted, and being seen as lesser.

If anything we are the generation that has rebelled against traditional ideas of masculinity or “machismo” the most. Of course you are still always going to have your more manly men since biologically speaking, having more testosterone in your body is usually going to make you a bit more driven, competitive, aggressive, and disagreeable, which is why men drift towards sports, combat/fighting, etc. 

Gen X teens and young adults during the 80s/90s for example were a million times bro-eir than us. Terms like “toxic masculinity” didn’t exist yet and nearly all dudes played some kind of sport since if you didn’t you were looked at as a nerd, geek, dork, dweeb, loser, etc. Maybe if you were into other more masculine hobbies like cars, lifting weights, hunting, certain types of music, etc you could possibly be seen as cool but jocks were usually always at the top of the social hierarchy.

Plus not every society/country is the same when it comes to machismo. In most of America playing/watching football, lifting, drinking beer, eating meat, driving cars, being stoic/nonchalant, and playing video games is seen as macho, but if you aren’t an athlete, are more emotionally vulnerable, etc most people aren’t going to think you’re a loser or “less of a man”, especially amongst Millennials or Gen Z. Being openly LGBTQ+ was also seen as very effeminate and womanly not too long ago but within the past decade American Millennials and Zoomers have become way more accepting of the LGBTQ community more so than past gens 

In other countries like Mexico however, the culture is still very machismo and men from all generations are still expected to act and carry themselves a very traditionally masculine way. Homophobia and transphobia is a way bigger problem there than it is in America too. But in other countries like Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, etc the ideas of masculinity and gender are even less rigid than they are in America. Women ask guys out on dates and even pay for them. In countries like India or Nigeria that really doesn’t happen, even amongst Zoomers.",4,1,0,zyn pouches,40

In High school where I taught history for 5 years. We have a weight gym that on average saw maybe 1 teacher and one or two athletes at 6am. And then bam we had 25-30kids both male and female every day. We had to build a whole new gym because there wasn’t enough racks or benches. Our wrestling team exploded and we even had to open up a women’s wrestling team before I left. That’s never really been a thing ever until recently. And these young women are killers and highly competitive. Then when they are done with wrestling practice they are going over to martial arts gyms in the city and training kickboxing and jiu jitsu. They are so busy they don’t even date or attend proms or homecomings. Yettt they all hang out and stick with each other. I attend a gym called “crunch” on the weekends Saturday and Sunday and they are all there because the school gym is closed. They are helping me be hip because Nike and adidas are dead except some shoes. It’s gymshark and “on clouds” then they share with me all the vitamins.

Let's go a step further, because they are white men (privileged) they have been told for the last decade that diversity doesn't apply to them has no places for them and hopes to limit them in favor of xyz. Although not the case it has its lasting impressions. 
Gen Z/late Millennial males have been repeatedly denigrated by older white males for being soy boys and so on, Gen Z males are trying to break the stigma and avoid being dragged if you would. 
Gen Z is more religious than the prior Millennals, even my friends where over joyed to not have to go to church anymore on Sundays.

Granted not the first time, as many militaries over history have targeted make adolescents for influencing.

Everywhere a young man goes online is going to be tailored by an algorithm that is going to notice certain habits (that would be common among make adolescents in general - bro or no) and seek to push them toward bro culture, because its associated with their demographic/age. This isn’t all, but I’d say a large contributor to why Gen Z make adolescents and young adults are more conservative, afraid of intellect (many in the US can’t read above a middle school level), and longing for a time that has been told to them was dominated by men and did not need to fear reprisal.",1,1,0,zyn pouches,40

If it feels like an uptick—and perhaps it is, I don’t have the data—it could be because the millennials rejected it more than prior generations had.

Cowboys, jocks, vigilante cops who weren’t afraid to break the rules, excessive bodybuilders pumping iron, 80’s Wall Street bros—these were all popular cultural characters for the boomers and Gen X.

Stomass-E-Elondrysl,2025-03-05 23:19:07,"Gen Z actually awoke my love for Bro Culture.

I'm a millennial who joined the AirForce 2 years after I graduated in 2012. We're talking $W4G times and polo's baby!!!

However, while in the military, it was VERY Anti Frat bro culture. You had people losing stripes for falling down stairs, a DUI would get you kicked out, and under Obama, they introduced the Force reduction Act, which allowed leaders to pretty much pick and choose who stayed in, which kicked out must of your head down hard workers, and let the brown nosers fly high into the next promotion.

The whole time I was in, it was like walking on eggshells around women because the heavy R word happened so frequently that they pretty much wouldn't do an investigation, they would just take a girls word for it, and throw you in prison. Also in 2015, we were told that there would be Trans soldiers who will be tasked with our jobs but due to hormone therapy, they will be ineligible for deployments, which means fewer and fewer would get there time at home.

Under trump from 2016 to 2020(and you're going to hate this)
A lot of the bullshit kinda went away. The trans thing was put on backlog, we were demobilizing a few stations in Iraq, and he genuinely wanted the countries that we protect to pay their dues. (I was overseas in England, and anywhere near the base was insane prices because they knew us Americans were good for it, so it made my opinion some what align with what Trump said) The military also felt more like a military with what we were getting involved in. 

I got out in 2020 after serving my contract, which ended under Biden. I seen a lot of bad shit coming full circle because we were being punished for going against the system. The Jab became a mandated thing and I know a few good airmen who were forced out, dishonorable, because they refused. (You can get caught selling cocaine, and get a discharge under General, then appeal it and get honorable) just to kind of explain that.

I can't speak much more of the military under biden, but what I can speak on, is that the woke culture is such a plague that it made me HATE it. That's exactly what has happened with this younger generation. They are tired of having to pretend what gender you are, your fake name, and if you're offended. It was their entire upbringing,except for those 4 years under Trump.

So of course they would elect the guy!


Edit: Looking at most of these replies to this, you're not going to change my mind on how I viewed the past 8 years of my life.
Am I a right-wing nut job? NO;  I have no allegiance to either side, only to America. If your reply is to try to prove a point about something I said, ask yourself, would you enjoy a conversation with someone who doesn't align with your political views on America saying that you're wrong for having an opinion? Probably not. Again, I stand by my above statement that you people are not friendly enough to help cultivate movements in the right direction and so people will easily sway to your other side simply because you're not on that side. 

Stop with the hero complex bullshit and just be a bit nicer; that is what Bro Culture is coming to.",-3,1,0,zyn pouches,40
fren-ulum,2025-03-06 06:25:07,"Weird, I had a different experience in the Army in some aspects.

2016 was when I had my first trans service member brief, and it basically boiled down to “treat people with respect” and that folks would be graded on their current sex assignment regardless of what they claim until the medical screening gives them the green light (which could take up to 2 years).

“Walking on eggshells” is a mindset and mentality YOU have.  Don’t cross boundaries and you’ll be fine like the majority of joes out there.  I don’t see how that’s difficult for people, but I guess that’s why we had to have SHARP trainings every couple months.



Near base prices were high, yes, but it wasn’t the end of the world.  Tipping can drivers who normally don’t ask for tips just cause Americans brought tipping culture there was annoying.

The Army recognized the stupid sloppy out of control “bro culture” was hurting force readiness and let me tell you, after the 3rd consecutive weekend of getting called in because some asshole can’t contain his alcohol, you get sick of it.

And the force reduction act actually started at the top with the Army, cutting out senior members of the military who were non-deployable or didn’t have current APFTs and quals to get forced out first.  Believe me, if we could easily get rid of window kickers, we would’ve.  There were a few names that I wouldn’t have mind chaptering out, but no, we couldn’t.

While there was certainly underreported push back to those initiatives, we see increased hesitancy correlate with the popularity of the anti-vax movement more strongly than anything else. While this time around, the anti-vax movement targeted the CoVID vaccines. In the past, we saw general vaccine hesitancy (in the armed forces this was apparent with AVIP) increase after the infamous Wakefield paper.

While the carbon monoxide and other trash in cigarettes slows down the healing process, nicotine by itself does as well. Pretty drastically. 

Look up some research on nicotine replacement therapies effects on wound healing. You get some mixed results. That,  factoring in the fact that the nicotine is getting absorbed by your mucus membranes in your face.. and it’s a surgery on your face.. I would do everything in my power to follow what doctors say. 

The general consensus is about a month after a major wound. 

All this being said, I have broken 11 bones in separate incidents and smoked through all of them and was healed early on almost all of them. 

I am not a good example. But just some food for thought.

These pouches have fucking 3 mg and 6mg of nicotine. They have lower nicotine than all smokeless tobacco and pan immense less number of carcinogens, way less hard on gum tissue.  


I’m all for weed being legal 💯  but kids aren’t warned of how addictive THC can be and how THC in the marijuana products sold is at a heavy unnatural amount. Again I’m 100% pro Marijuana.

If kids‘ vices is to throw in these pussy pouches nowadays we should let it happen. Just don’t encourage gutting zyn or any nicotine supplements for that matter. Idk why the fuck ppl would swallow and zyn or dip. And I’m speaking to myself because I’ve done it in situations that I had to gut a few dozen times.

WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING ELSE WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT TEENAGERS PUTTING IN THEIR BODIES? FUCKING FAST FOOD. FUCKING WAY WORSE FOR YOUR THAN A DOG DAMN ZYN. WANT PROOF? EAT McDONALDS FOR BREAKFAST LUNCH AND DINNER EVERYDAY FOR A MONTH. THE NEXT MONTH QUIT FAST FOOD AND TOSS IN A ZYN AFTER EVERY BREAKFAST LUNCH AND DINNER. HELL, TOSS IN 2 AFTER EACH. SEE WHICH  MONTH YOU FEEL BETTER.

Not knocking ppl who use zyns! I enjoy them and think they’re a hell of an alternative to dip and are much less unhealthy than most common social vices. Thanks for posting OP I’m glad you posted. Wasn’t lashing out at you at all just lashing out at the stupid fucking media. Saw on the news the other day how zyns are so unhealthy because few dudes got stomach inflammation after using 30+ zyn pouches a day. So therefore zyns are dangerous. Dumb shit? 30+ zyns a day is fucking stupid and you WILL NOT get stomach inflammation from zyns or any dip if you aren’t gutting it. If I was tossing in 30 dips of zyn a day for months and gutting them 24/7, I wouldn’t be surprised at stomach inflation, I’d EXPECT it. Lol.

RossCamerone,2025-06-06 12:45:11,"Zyn pouches are made primarily from plant-based, food-grade cellulose fibers, often derived from eucalyptus or pine. This material acts as a carrier for the nicotine and flavor components. The outer pouch is similar to tea bag paper, a breathable, nonwoven fabric made from a blend of natural cellulose and sometimes synthetic fibers like polyethylene or polypropylene to improve durability and control moisture release.

The nicotine inside is either tobacco-derived or synthetic and is mixed with food-safe stabilizers, pH buffers like sodium carbonate, flavorings, and sweeteners such as xylitol or Acesulfame K.

If you’re looking to source similar pouch materials, manufacturers of tea bag or filter paper like Ahlstrom or Glatfelter are a good place to start. There are also suppliers that sell heat-sealable filter paper rolls for sachets, which could work for prototyping.",2,1,0,zyn pouches,61

Alternatively I believe  FRE will ship to California although only unflavored I believe and there is a website snus mee or something like that where you can order directly from Sweden, and there have been reports on this sub Reddit that orders have successfully cleared customs and been delivered to domiciles in California.

I dislike nicorette because every flavor is minty inside which I'm allergic to. If you don't have a problem with mint then any nicotine gum will likely be fine for you. I like gum because it also keeps my mouth busy in addition to satisfying the nicotine cravings. I use 4mg gum but there's also 2mg available if 4mg is too strong, and 4mg is pretty strong. I have a friend who smokes 2 packs a day and the 4 mg gum is too strong for him, straight up makes him nauseous and hiccuping like crazy. Meanwhile sometimes I'll chew 2 of the 4mg pieces...

but they can use in America it's not carcinogenic or anything it comes down to regulatory standards but I found a channel called Snus  at home on YouTube and obviously it tells you what you can make but he was talking something about how I can't remember it's you it's either something to do with the alkaline or the salt that increases the nicotine absorption rate quicker and he said if you add too much you'll get a huge rush real quick so now I'm looking into possibly making my own Zyn sort of thing at home and adding a little extra of the salt to get a quicker hit I'm not sure but I think the salt is ammonium chloride",1,0,1,zyn pouches,75

I can quit Copenhagen Pouches with very little effort. Like 3 a day for a week, 2 and done.
I made the mistake of trying Rogue pouches while quitting once and was craving a new pouches every 15 mins. It hits fast and makes it harder to quit by increasing your capacity to hold more in your blood stream.

 i was using almost a can of zyn daily 9mg, now i do the same amount of nic in snus and feel much better/less addicted.

Kotal_Ken,2025-01-03 10:50:48,"I disagree with the people saying tapering doesn't work. I tapered off and I'm almost 2 years nicotine free. Most of you who quit cold turkey cave after a month or two because you can't handle it. The success rate is abysmally low, but not because of the method being used.

Reality is, both the cold turkey and tapering method work. Cold turkey isn't right for everyone and every situation, and tapering isn't right for everyone and every situation. You've gotta choose the method that works best for you and your life situation. 

With that said, I switched from 6 mg Zyn to 3mg Zyn and used that for about a month. I gave my body time to adjust to the new dose. Then I switched to 2mg ON! pouches. Did those for maybe 3 weeks. My final step was to switch to 2mg nicotine gum for a week (I got away from the pouches first, then nicotine....baby steps). And then I let go.

I never established a daily limit during this taper. Instead, every time I thought about using a pouch, I asked myself *""Do I really need one right now, or can I wait a while?""* 

Every time, my answer was that I can wait awhile, and I found myself going 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and sometimes 2 hours without one. Not only did this naturally cut down my daily intake, but it gave me the confidence to be able to go long stretches of time without Zyn. 

This strategy worked for me. It might not work for you. But if you feel that you'll have the greatest success with tapering, and you're not just using it as an excuse to use longer, then go for it. Just remember, eventually you've gotta let go. 

One final thought. My approach is a longer approach. If you want to quit the Zyn pouches faster, you could switch over to the patches and follow the step down approach with those. Then, if you find that you have an oral craving for pouches, Amazon sells these caffeine/nootropic pouches that you can use to fill the void. I used Grinds and Teaza (they're bigger than Zyns though), but I'm hearing great things about the NZE pouches being the same size as Zyn. And there's no nicotine in these pouches. 

So...there you have it. You DO have options if you recognize that you don't have the mental strength for cold turkey.",11,1,0,zyn pouches,87

Bencu20,2025-01-03 05:24:43,"Not sure what answer you expect. I personally don't really believe that the gradual approach works, especially if you're already on only 3 pouches of 6mg, sounds more like postponing the inevitable. If you really want to, any lower dose that you can gradually decrease will get you closer. So maybe 3 3mg pouches/day for a week, than just 2 etc 

But honestly, if you manage on just 3 per day i don't think your withdrawals will be bad, and def not longer than a few days.",6,1,0,zyn pouches,87
smeagolswagger,2025-01-03 06:48:13,"I agree. this point if OP wants to lower there aren't a ton of options.


Switch to ON! Brand which has a 2mg. 3 pouches a day at 2mg is almost nothing. 


Drop to two pouches a day.


Go on amazon and buy Teaza pouches or any of the other caffeine pouches to give yourself something to binge on thats not nicotine. I recommend Teaza but I've heard good things about the Alpha pouches as well.

JenBunny06,2025-01-03 14:25:15,"I was on 6 mgs when I wanted to quit and I had one can of 3 mgs and a partial can of 2 mg ""Ons"" left. After I finished the 6s I had left, I finished the can of 3s and then went to the 2s. All the while knowing I was ready to quit. 

When I switched to 2s, I was only doing 2-3 of them per day. So when I ran out I was coming off 4-6 mg per day instead of 42 mg/day when I was doing the 6s.

Between being ready to quit, winding down and using other helpers (hard candies, gum, snow peas, the app I Am Sober), it definitely made it easier to quit. It was easier than the other times I had tried to quit and now I'm 25 days off nicotine.

HuachumaPuma,2025-03-24 21:27:25,Nicotine is not exactly a stimulant. It has a number of novel effects and has been used in traditional Native American medicine for ages.

I don't create a lot of spit when I have a pouch shoved in my lip, Nothing at all like Long cut. I always had just swallowed.
I've seen that the price of Copenhagen varies significantly based upon each state. I guess each state has a more expensive or a less expensive tobacco tax. I can get Copenhagen across the border for me in Kentucky for anywhere between five dollars a can or up to 550 per can. And when you go to Casey's general store, you usually get a discount When purchasing a minimum of two cans. But I also use my Copenhagen coupons at Casey's which save a lot of money. I don't think I'd be dipping Copenhagen if it was just around $10 per can. I would definitely switch to Stoker if Copenhagen was that expensive since it's so much cheaper.",1,1,0,zyn pouches,90

One year ago (approx.) I started using pouches first Zyn then *ON BRAND.* I specifically chose ON BRAND as they are cheaper.  I have developed high blood pressure, and extreme swelling in extremities so bad that I literally can't move. 

A years worth of doctors testing, scans, cts ,blood work , specialists. No one had any answers why this was happening to me. After an ER visit a few days ago the doctor was going over a list of medications I take and he says,"" Can you think of anything that has changed over the past year?"".  The next day Friday I realized it's the pouches, so still being so addicted I switched brands Saturday and purchased Zone brand.  

It has only been 24 hours, and the swelling has reduced considerably. This of course is not scientific but nothing else has worked, medications, diet,etc. .

Try Dryft too, personally, dryft pouches are too small for me and don’t have enough kick, but you’d be better off with either Dryft or Zyn than Velo

As part of the agreement, Velo should only target existing smokers/vapers around the station, and that they follow the Challenge 25 policy. Therefore, this product should not be promoted to any non-smokers or people that are underage. We will ensure that they are reminded of this.


Nicotine pouches are not in breach of our code of acceptance, providing they are only promoted as a healthier alternative product to vapers and smokers.

mrtyrd,2025-04-16 16:23:07,"Response from networks rail to my complaint:
Thank you for providing feedback on your recent experience at Bristol Temple Meads. We aim for all our customers to have a positive experience at our stations, and I’m sorry on this occasion that you feel we missed the mark.

As you would expect we have a Code of Acceptance that ensures promotions and advertisements within our station environment are appropriate.

Firstly, I can confirm this is a valid exhibition booking which has been organised by SpaceandPeople, who managed our exhibition spaces, and the correct process was followed.

As part of the agreement, Velo should only target existing smokers/vapers around the station, and that they follow the Challenge 25 policy. Therefore, this product should not be promoted to any non-smokers or people that are underage. We will ensure that they are reminded of this.

Nicotine pouches are not in breach of our code of acceptance, providing they are only promoted as a healthier alternative product to vapers and smokers.

Many thanks again for taking the time to share your feedback.

Snus pouches deliver high and consistent amounts of nicotine into your system which is a natural laxative and bowel stimulant.

Don't worry, it will just be because you're not used to them yet, you will get used to them though.

Warning!! I've found snus to be the most addictive form of nicotine I've ever used, and I was an 8 year pack a day smoker. So I'd be very careful.

This is probably an acceptable part of the design so you just spit it and use more, but it's faintly gross, the original version felt time release enough without that trait, and it's just a lot of weird thickener to gulp down in part to make spitting the spent pouch not a slimy mess likely to make folks around you want to hurl.  


As much as I use these out of necessity and religious reasons (function with nicotine, really shouldn't be making flames on shabbos).. well, thank G-d there's an option to slow down from 8mg On!s and it might be more tolerable with a less what-I-mentioned texture (something more like a gummy bear, tootsie roll or gum or something?) but as is, it's hilarious but not giving reason to prefer it except, longer-lasting / slower release to calm down after getting acclimated to heart stopping amounts of nicotine.  Just give me my nicotine and flavor I don't need more grit and agar than it takes to dole it out over an hour or two, though in fairness they probably have that duration thing going for them.  


It's gross to have to question whether to swallow that much spent filler, although I guess it's food-grade excipient.",1,1,0,velo pouches,123

wolframite,2024-12-17 21:33:34,"That's interesting to know as I'm Tokiholio and all I have known are Japanese-spec'd VELOs. (they don't have ZYNs and other brands in Japanistan but I did see some *snus* at a local tobacco shop). 

I don't know whether that makes the difference but ""technically"" the Japanese VELOs are NOT synthetic tobacco although they look and taste like they are. Rather, they contain nicotine that has been extracted from tobacco, and for that reason, meet the Japanese regulations prohibiting *synthetic* nicotine (like ZYN). 

The Japanese VELOs are also exceedingly cheap. A single 15-pouch cannister costs exactly JPY 300 or $2.00 USD. 

And although I decided to quit nicotine pouches altogether ...now now... I avoided the mint & wintergreen flavors and instead went for the flavors like Milk Tea, Mango & Berry.",1,0,1,velo pouches,123

IMO I preferred the euro version, but compared to what else they sell at 7/11 around me, they're better. Also can't order like we used to.

The wintergreen is great. I’ll say I didn’t love the old citrus much and do love the new ones. The plus pouches look and feel very similar to the Lucy Pouches sold on NicoKick if anyone here has fucked with those.

I decided to switch it up and use nicorette gum and that made quitting so much more tolerable for me. The gum didn’t  do much for me except moderate the craving to manageable levels. It also allowed me to stay mentally clear enough to focus at work. I have since weened off of the gum and am 2 weeks free of nicotine. The whole process took me about 3 weeks of weening starting from 5/6 pieces of 4mg gum down to one piece of 2mg gum a day.

The new pouches they changed to a meager particle size so even when there is a hole it’s nowhere near like what it used to be.

That all being said, you should report it when you find it. Generally if you buy on line they will replace it and then they pass that back to the manufacturer. Without being told about it the manufacturer likely won’t catch it as it’s not likely to be seen until the product has been shipped and moved around a lot.

Maximum_Teacher_6060,2025-01-05 08:38:09,"I will post an update about the experience. Order was placed on 1-5-25. I ordered Ettan and Göteborgs Rapé (from snusme) (despite it being on the red list). The ettan was ordered from snus 24. I've been ordering from Snuscentral for years and years and am absolutely livid. While I can purchase General snus in person in my state (it's readily available at many gas stations), General is not my favorite by any stretch. I'm not a fan of NPs as they basically feel like a jolt of just pure nicotine.

I really can't stand the US smokeless tobacco market. The flavors are garbage and all taste like bubble gum (wintergreen, mint flavors). Swedish snus is like the caviar of tobacco. I have no idea why Swedish Snus hasn't taken over the US as it is a vastly superior product. I'm also not really sure why there seems to be a small market for General snus in the US but not much else. It seems like there would be room for expansion.

I was scanning the poorly written FDA material (there are typos in it) and it seems like they singled out certain products (skruf, Göteborgs Rapé). Why is snuscentral blocking all the other brands that aren't even mentioned on the red list? It seems like a drastic measure from someone that didn't even have a lawyer look things over and parse out exactly what it means. They could also possibly look into potential work-arounds (labeling, etc). Instead they reconfigured their entire website to block all tobacco products to the US, when the language from the FDA seems to be much narrower than a blanket ban. Does anyone know how the other companies that are supposedly still shipping to the US are interpreting these new developments?",6,1,0,velo pouches,195
Snusalskare,2025-01-05 11:09:33,">Why is snuscentral blocking all the other brands that aren't even mentioned on the red list?

Just an educated guess here, but it seems to me that the most reasonable explanation is that they (and Snusdirect too) ran into problems with their UPS World Ease shipping contract, and were told by UPS that they are not allowed to ship tobacco products at the moment (for how long, who knows).

Such a contract pause/pull would have been due to UPS detecting an inordinately high number of customs refusals from a particular client (if you look at the generic UPS rules regarding the international shipment of tobacco products, there is a clause which states that it is the responsibility of the shipper to ensure that everything they have contracted UPS to ship into a country is legal to import into that country) and an apparent breach of contract terms by the vendor. UPS holds all of the cards in this case, and as a major international air freight shipper is not going to do anything to get themselves in trouble with the customs authorities in the countries where they do business, especially for the comparatively tiny amount of $ they are making from what are essentially small mom-and-pop e-tailer operations in Sweden (online searches show recent annual revenue for MaKe WeBo AB as only \~$3 million, which is really small business-level sales numbers, even for a tiny country like Sweden; whereas UPS contracts with major multi-national corporations, on the other hand, easily run into the 100s of millions annually just in shipping fee revenue alone).

At the same time, UPS wants to make money, no matter how tiny and financially humble the client, so if this is indeed what is at the root of the issue, I am sure they are giving the vendors some time figure things out and come back to them with assurances as to how they are going to abide by their UPS World Ease contract terms going forward.

If UPS becomes a no-go in the end, I suspect that the affected vendors will likely try to find a workaround (Post Nord maybe? DHL / Deutsche Post perhaps?) at some point. The US market is just too big for these vendors to fully abandon without major repercussions for their bottom lines.

Can these manufactures not just fix their labels to comply? The only hurdle is I guess they’d have to specifically label some portion of their product as for the U.S. market only. Apparently the labeling requirements are (copied from the Alert):

1) the name and place of business of the tobacco product manufacturer, packer, or distributor;

2) an accurate statement of the quantity of the contents in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count; and

The issue with Goteborgs specifically I think is that they don't have a sticker on the can that says 'For US Sale Only' which is a requirement from the FDA now (doesn't make sense why, if you're ordering snus it's probably for personal use, but I'm not a G-man).

phager76,2025-01-15 10:39:45,"I wanted to give an update on current ordering information, as well as what I've heard from SnusCentral on shipping.

I mentioned up thread that I've ordered through SnusCentral almost exclusively since early 2010. My last order from them was on 12/4 and it was shipped without issue and arrived on December 9th. That one actually had some issues because when I ordered 3 rolls of my goto, it gave me the option of using Swedish Post (2 and 4 rolls only had UPS options), so obviously, I had to go for it. I was told that wasn't a valid shipping method, so they upgraded it to UPS for free (I was honestly expecting to have to pay, and was fine with it, so kudos for that). It retrospect, I should've known something was up, but hindsight and all.

>Good morning, I attempted to order snus from your site over the weekend, and was saddened to find out that I can no longer order snus from your company in the US. I'm assuming this is due to the new 'Red List' from the FDA, but I'm confused why no snus is available to ship to the US, regardless of it's status on the list.

>If you check my order history (associated with this email address), I've been a loyal customer since, I believe, early 2010. I occasionally tried other companies, but always came back home to SnusCentral. I had to place an order through a new to me site, since I could at least get something shipped. Are there any plans at the moment to reintroduce shipping to the states?

So it seems like they're just exercising an abundance of caution, which makes sense given how the situation is still evolving.

The whole situation is frustrating as hell. I was set with Thunder Frosted, and then it was randomly discontinued a couple of years back. It took a while, but I finally managed to settle on Puck Spearing as a 'good enough' replacement for my beloved Thunder Ultra Frosted. Now with this new twist, I can't seem to find anyone that sells that. Looking at the sheet above, it looks like N&J Green Ice is a spearmint flavor profile, so I'll give that a shot on my next order. I dunno why it's so damn hard to find an extra sterk spearmint, everything is peppermint or wintergreen. If anyone knows a good Thunder Frosted replacement, you'll be my hero forever!

After some research over the weekend, it looked like SnusMe was pretty well regarded, so I placed a small order with them on Sunday evening. It's giving a delivery date of today, but the tracking shows it as having been warehouse scanned in Philly today, and is preparing for clearance. To be honest, I'm pretty impressed with SnusMe, the import scan was done in Philly yesterday morning. So they basically processed the order and got it to my state in under 48 hours. At this point, it's at the whims of Customs and UPS. I am a little concerned, since I ordered a roll of Oden's Cold to try, and just noticed today that the Oden's brand looks to be on the red list, so we'll see what happens there.

Hearing that Larry's retired from SnusCentral, I don't feel so bad about defecting to somewhere else. Thanks for putting this all together Snubie!! It's super helpful!",3,1,0,velo pouches,195

He speculated that Philip Morris, who recently bought Zyn, may have lawyers review competitors labels, and apply pressure to get them to enforce certain regulations, AKA ""regulatory capture.""

Sandviper71,2025-02-19 16:40:19,"I ordered from. Snusme about 2 weeks ago literally the day before they decided not to do any more to the US. It was PostNord, so I was doubtful I would ever see it and pretty much started to transition to nicotine pouches until I could wean myself off nicotine. I like white fox in the blue can, and Siberia all white, but it wasn't the same as the real thing. I was already tiring of them too. Today I stopped by my mom's house as that's where they go since someone is always there to sign. Went to pick up my son and I spotted a box on the table..sweet lord it was my order! Not only that, it was too big for the mailbox, but instead of taking it to the post office, they knocked on the door. I received about 10 cans of One Gray, 3 cans of One Blue, 2 cans XRange GR strong slim, 2 cans of Moose mint, and a Lundgrens Skargarden, for about 64 bucks.. not bad, that's 3.50 per can. Must have been a sale...  Not exactly sure how that worked out because I figure that's roughly the amount before shipping. So, about a week ago, I ordered from SwedishProducts.com. PostNord or UPS. 20 Cans this time. I chose UPS. Received an email today telling me it would be going through PostNord instead, so I emailed their customer service. They apologized for the error and told me if for some reason it doesn't come to my address, to let them know and they would re ship at no extra cost.. Apparently I didn't luck out with the shipping cost, as the total for this one is right at 100 dollars, but that's still only 5 bucks a can. I may not get as lucky with the postman either, but I figure even if I have to pay 70 bucks extra, it still works out to roughly 6 dollars a can (Assuming this one gets through customs). That's about 2 or 3 dollars cheaper than General per can here in my neck of the woods. I have to admit though, that's some damn good customer service, so I ain't complaining.. I have never tried this particular Lundgrens, this is some really good stuff. It's too bad snusme stopped shipping here, but I highly recommend SwedishProducts.com if you are willing to risk it..",1,1,0,velo pouches,195
Kfin1313,2025-02-21 03:39:44,I order 20 XQS from Snussie. Of course package is stuck in FDA clearance… so basically just chalk it up to a loss or it’s a coin flip if it makes it out?,1,1,0,velo pouches,195
Sandviper71,2025-02-22 21:36:55,"I would order XQS  from prilla.com  if I were using that particular brand. The site is based in America so it ships from the states as opposed to coming directly from Sweden.  Not sure how they get it into their warehouse so they can sell em, but whatever it is, that site is reliable. While you will wait more than a week or two, I haven't had an order take longer than that. They only sell nic pouches though. That said, they also sell whitefox and Siberia all white. And shipping has been dirt cheap since they're located in the states. Might be worth checking out if that is your brand..not sure why it takes as long as it does to ship, but it will arrive. Least it has for me when I needed it.  If my recent order from SwedishProducts gets through,  I would recommend them too. They don't have a ton of brands, but they do have actual snus and several brands such as one red, xrange rape, general, etc..  and they still ship to the US. As for PostNord,  it arrived,  but still took a few weeks. It came from snusme, whom the very next day stopped shipping snus to the states. I tried the other sites allegedly still selling to the US, but when I get to checkout, I get the not shipping to US message from those sites. The  package from snusme arrived through PN, and was in a box too large for the mailbox, so the mailman knocked on the door. From what I hear, they would normally would have made me pick it up at a post office,  so reckon I was lucky.  As for being stuck with the FDA, that really doesn't mean much (most likely) other than they are a pain in the ass but, just from my experience with orders of late, it will get through. I have not had one stolen by the FDA gestapo yet. It's a risk, but as long as you only spend an amount  on an order you can afford to lose, then it becomes  less of a big deal should they decide to confiscate.  If nothing else, if it takes a bit to arrive to you, and you have given up on it, then suddenly it arrives out of nowhere,  it just adds to the joy of getting the package..life's little victories.......",1,0,1,velo pouches,195

Sandviper71,2025-02-26 18:52:02,"Well, just received my second PostNord order, this one from SwedishProducts.com.  took roughly 2 weeks, maybe a day or two less. And the mailman did not even bother knocking on the door, I found it on the porch! That said, they are a little pricey, but since I didn't have to pay the extra fee some folks reported, customs or duties, etc., it wound up being about 5 bucks a can after shipping. I am really digging this Red One. When you first put that in it is possibly the best flavor, including mint which I use to use primarily up til odens got red listed, that I've ever had, nice raspberry flavor, may a touch of cherry. It goes great with cola. The cherry esq flavor does go away too soon and then it's a little tart, but still good. Only problem is, since I like it, I probably will never see it again because somewhere along the way I ticked off the tobacco Gods and they punish me by taking away my favorite brands.. maybe if I sacrifice a goat? Anyways, SwedishProducts.com is good, seem reliable as any of em can be at this point, and so far, I am 2 -0 with PostNord, so I would recommend them but there is still that risk of getting hijacked by the FDA/Customs..

UPS said it would cut 20,000 jobs this year as it overhauls its US network to boost efficiency.
The shipping giant plans to shutter 73 facilities and save $3.5 billion as demand remains soft.
The cuts are linked to the ""changing trade environment,"" UPS CEO Carol Tomé said.

UPS plans to slash 20,000 jobs this year as part of a cost-cutting drive amid the shifting global trade landscape triggered by President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The move comes as the shipping giant grapples with soft demand, especially from its largest customers. UPS said it would also look to close 73 facilities by the end of June.

The urinals and toilets are full of them. Whenever I go into my office, almost everyone I work with - no matter gender - are likely using snus. 

In contrast, vaping and smoking are incredibly rare (vs the UK where I grew up and Ireland where I lived before Sweden). 

Yet according to the WCRF, Swedens cancer rates are drastically lower than the US, UK and Ireland.

It’s really bad because they talk about it being non addictive which is isnaaaaane. In the podcast with Tucker iirc. 

I didn’t fall for the ads I knew what I was getting into, I just really wanted to quit vaping, I knew I would be addicted to Zynn. But they have a young audience who may have started Zynn and even thought it was not addictive.

Also the reason I switched to Zynn is that it’s even easier to hide than vaping, and being easy to hide was a big factor in being able to smoke when I was young. Cigs smell to obvious, vaping doesn’t. Now Zynn looks like you have gum in. I hide it now cause it’s cringe to do nic, but kids will hide it from their parents.

Also I had seen Zynn before but Nelk advertising it gave it credibility and influenced me to switch. And that was the same team they blew up irl, at least in my uni and age group. Random strikers with people with Zynns that never posted them before that week.",49,1,0,velo pouches,203

firesatnight,2024-03-11 05:37:37,"Just want to say that after 20+ years of smoking cigarettes, over a pack a day at the end, Zyn was the only thing that ever worked to get me off of them. Granted, I was then addicted to Zyn for about 2-3 years and I think my addiction to Zyn was even stronger than cigarettes because I could use Zyn literally anywhere and no one would know whereas with smoking you generally have to be outside and find a designated area.

In order to quit Zyn, I used 1mg nicotine lozenges (which are surprisingly hard to find). Now I'm about 6 months completely off nicotine. 

One thing I'm going to say about your post is, stop calling Zyn SNUS if you want anyone to treat you like an expert. SNUS has tobacco and Zyn doesn't. Zyn is better for you than any other product by all metrics but one - nicotine. And it is a LOT of nicotine. But I felt a million times better being able to use nicotine without the smoking or tobacco.

Anyways - hope this doesn't come off as a Zyn ad, and I know their advertising is predatory and sneaky. Their direct advertising is an alternative to tobacco, but as you pointed out, there is indirect advertising going on where they are trying to get new users addicted and make Zyn ""cool"".

Basically it looked at teenagers that were using e-cigs already but not smoking and teenagers that were using neither, and the group that was using e-cigs were three more times likely to use cigarettes in the 30-day study period. This is a strong correlation, but is NOT causation. We don’t actually know if vaping/e-cig use increases the likelihood teens start smoking. It could very well be those teens were just more likely to engage in risky behaviors in the first place (kind of like how cigarette use is correlated with tons of other risky behaviors).

Bailbondsman,2024-03-11 04:12:56,"Sorry but I have to strongly disagree with your post.

For anyone here who seems to be confused, nicotine pouches are not snus. Snus is a tobacco product and is a carcinogen which means it causes cancer. Snus is also banned in the EU outside of Sweden, but nicotine pouches are not.

Tobacco-less nicotine pouches are not carcinogenic, and there is absolutely no scientific evidence that nicotine alone causes cancer.

That being said, I have smoked cigarettes for years, more than a decade, stopping here and there for months but ultimately coming back to it.

It’s on this podcast that I first heard about nicotine pouches and have since started using them instead of smoking. Of course I don’t want to be addicted to nicotine, but using nicotine pouches is infinitely better and healthier than smoking cigarettes all day, and I can definitely tell the difference.

Of course, no one is saying than a non-smoker should pick up nicotine out of nowhere. That was the point of the Andrew Schulz clip and why Ethan talked about it. It was also part of what Zack said when he first mentioned them- he has replaced cigarette smoking with nicotine pouches.

Nicotine is horribly addictive and it’s always a terrible idea to start using it. But there are laws in place that prevent kids and teens from purchasing any nicotine products, including nicotine pouches. If companies are targeting teens with advertising, that should be stopped by laws and regulations.

But I don’t think that H3 is a podcast for teens. There are many discussions on H3 that are geared towards adults. Kids and teens shouldn’t be consuming energy drinks, and an energy drink sponsors the podcast. They discuss alcohol, and Ethan did a membership drive where he got almost dangerously drunk. That is definitely not content that should be consumed by anyone underage.

However, I really need to add a comment on the discussion when I’m reading someone say that a much healthier alternative to tobacco use shouldn’t be discussed on the show because the product is dangerous to teens. If it wasn’t discussed, I wouldn’t have ever known about it.",12,1,0,velo pouches,203

Yes, but shouldn't we have restrictions on how these products can be marketed? It's why we put earning labels on cigarette packs (they work) - it's why we put disclaimer's on pharma and alcohol.

OP never once said to ban these products, but to monitor the way these companies market their products (which they said is their job) because they ARE targeting young people, especially teens. When my mom was in HS she said she could go outside on lunch break and smoke cigarettes freely. When I was in HS (about 2011-2015) smoking cigarettes was one of the lamest things you could do and was just becoming super unpopular with my generation. Then came vapes, kids arent able to understand that they ""need to take personal responsibility"" and not give into peer pressure, they're kids, they're stupid and will do anything to impress their friends, be popular, etc, etc. because when you're in school all you care about is what other people think.

BlueFlame1203,2025-01-24 23:06:33,"##Copied and pasted from u/wolframite (in another comment section):

Okay - I’m in Japanistan where aside from snus, the only available nicotine pouch at this moment seems to be VELO. And, I am not 100% certain but pretty sure that they are the same as what you call VELO Plus elsewhere in the world.

The type of nicotine in the Japanese VELO (and probably the VELO Plus) is nicotine polacrilex. I believe that most nicotine pouches in the US contain nicotine salt instead...

 Nicotine Polacrilex vs. Nicotine Salts in Nicotine Pouches

Nicotine Polacrilex

•	⁠Definition: Nicotine bound to a polacrilex resin (like methacrylic acid polymer).
•	⁠Purpose: Gradual, controlled nicotine release, commonly used in nicotine replacement therapy (e.g., gums, lozenges).
•	⁠Absorption:
	⁠•	⁠Slower release through oral mucosa.
	⁠•	⁠Less intense and more therapeutic.
•	⁠User Experience: Provides a mild, steady nicotine effect suitable for smoking cessation or controlled dosing.

 Nicotine Salts

•	⁠Definition: Nicotine combined with an acid (e.g., benzoic acid) to form a salt, reducing pH and harshness.
•	⁠Purpose: Faster, smoother nicotine absorption, used in recreational products like modern pouches or vapes.
•	⁠Absorption:
	⁠•	⁠Rapid absorption through oral mucosa due to better bioavailability.
	⁠•	⁠Provides a quicker, more pronounced nicotine hit.
•	⁠User Experience: Delivers a strong, fast-acting effect similar to smoking or vaping.

 Summary:

•	⁠Nicotine Polacrilex = Slower, milder, therapeutic.
•	⁠Nicotine Salts = Faster, smoother, recreational.",2,1,0,2one pouches,212
Direct-Detective2005,2025-01-25 11:27:15,"The only pouch in the U.S. that I’m aware of actually having Nicotine Salts would be Zyn. I suppose it is totally possible that the difference I’m feeling is due to that. I used to vape, and I remember feeling a difference in effectiveness when switching to Nicotine Salts based e-liquid as well. Interesting. Also, VELO Plus is a new release in the U.S. whereas we only had VELO before, which seemed to come in 2 forms. There were these metal tins that contained slightly moist pouches which seem to have been discontinued, and there are small round plastic cans that contained a small dry pouch in various flavors. VELO plus is a larger plastic can with slightly larger moist pouches that provide a decent nicotine buzz.",1,0,1,2one pouches,212
