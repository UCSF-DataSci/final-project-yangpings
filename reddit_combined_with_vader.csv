Latter_Company_3357,2024-02-12 17:07:36,"i just created a reddit account to write you this, please listen. i am a university computer science student and a heavy lifting addict. i used nicotine pouches and snus the past 5 years, mostly nicotine pouches(the white ones). i used a pack every 1 1/2 day. everything was fine since one day i was going to the gym, and suddenly my brain felt like it is going to collapse, i looked for a place where i can sit but i was in public and i was afraid that i am gonna be knocked out there, so i ran to the gym. i never expereienced something like that, i was always 200 % healthy in my life never even had a migrane once ( i am 24 years old). so i was sitting in the gym til it got better, after that i still trained, idk why. everything went to normal and i could drive home with public transport. waking up the next day, drinking a coffe, taking snus, it started again but much much worse, also my belly was extremly bloated it felt like it cuts my air to breath off. you should know i am a very tough guy but i never experienced something like that and i was afraid, i live in a student dorm, without a family, i did not know what to do, i was afraid for my life that i die really. i called the ambulance, first time in my life, , and was almost not even able to walk to the car, because i almost passed out. i had a pulse of 200 the ambulance measured. the hospital said my blood was ok, nothing found and they threw me out. i called my parents to pick me up at [4.am](https://4.am) from another city. i lived 1 monht at my parents home and couldn't visit university and had to skip 1 semester. also my neck was extremly stiff and i tought, everything was from working out my neck to hard lol. i also took ashwaganda at the time and tought it caused it, so i stopped. it still persisted. i gained 20 kg fat weight, afraid to work out again. suddenly i decreased taking nicotine pouches to test if maybe it is the reason. so instead of cold turkey i decreased the amount i take everyday, after 2 weaks i was off and suddenly the extreme belly bloat and neck stiffness went away, it fucked up my gut so bad that it fucked my life. i needed almost 1 year to fully recover, this is no joke. i took probiotics to heal my gut quickly and everything is fine now. plese stop taking it, i beg you, it fucks up your gut, honestly i think even smoking is healthier because if the gut is fucked up your life is not live worthy anymore. please stop anyone, dont do cold turkey, do it slowly, it destroyed my life and i hope the damage it has done is reversable, learn from me. god bless.

Chemical_Raccoon_184,2025-03-10 01:36:33,"i went from cigarettes to vaping. then i switched to zyns to quit vaping because everyone online kept saying they were the ""healthier"" option. but honestly, they‚Äôre not. nicotine pouches and snus are actually one of the worst ways to consume nicotine long term.

there are two main reasons why:

1. you‚Äôre absorbing nicotine continuously for hours.


2. the total amount of nicotine absorbed is higher than most people realize.


for example:

8 zyns at 6mg = 48mg total, around 26mg absorbed. that‚Äôs a heavy intake. like a pack of cigarettes per day.

8 zyns at 3mg = 24mg total, about 13mg absorbed ‚Äî still more than most people think. and again, it‚Äôs constant, slow absorption throughout the day. that's like half pack of cigarettes per day.


these pouches should be for situations where you can't vape or smoke, like during a long flight‚Äînot for everyday use. the steady nicotine delivery is just too much for the body over time.


i went back to vaping 9mg freebase juice at about 1.5ml per day. that‚Äôs roughly 13.5mg intake and only ~5mg absorbed (like 4 cigarettes). i feel way better now compared to when i was using only zyns.

zyns, pouches, and snus aren‚Äôt the ""safest"" nicotine options. honestly, vaping is obviously the least harmful method overall.

many wall street bankers use adderall and vyvanse as tools to plow through long hours of tedious work amid high-pressure competition.

[https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/young-banker-finance-adhd-medication-adderall-d578a16f](https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/young-banker-finance-adhd-medication-adderall-d578a16f)

as mark moran was facing another 90-hour week as an investment-banking intern at credit suisse in new york, he knew he needed help to survive the rest of the summer. his colleagues gave him a tip: visit a wall street health clinic and tell the staff he had trouble focusing.

ahead of his first appointment, he filled out a five-minute questionnaire. one of the questions asked if he had trouble staying organized, another, if he procrastinated. he then met with a clinician who said his answers suggested he had attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. he left with a prescription for adderall.

no matter that a family member, a psychologist, didn‚Äôt think moran had adhd. he found that when he took adderall, he could keep working for hours, and was able to actually be interested in some of the mundane tasks required of a young investment banker, such as aligning corporate logos on a powerpoint or formatting cells in microsoft excel. 

he also wanted to show his bosses he was a hard worker and eventually secure a lucrative full-time job offer after finishing graduate school.

‚Äúthey gave me a script, and within months, i was hooked,‚Äù said moran, now 33 years old and running his own investor-relations firm. he‚Äôs also a provocative personality on social media, commenting on finance, politics and culture, including prescription drug use. ‚Äúyou become dependent on it to work.‚Äù

images of wall street‚Äôs rank-and-file blowing cash on illegal drugs and nightlife are well known, with cocaine a favored drug through the 1980s, as portrayed in ‚Äúthe wolf of wall street.‚Äù 

these days, drugs are more a tool to optimize performance on the job. especially for entry-level bankers at the analyst and associate level‚Äîwho work long, tedious hours and fiercely compete for higher-level jobs with big pay days‚Äîprescriptions for stimulants such as adderall and other adhd drugs have become commonplace.  

jonah frey, who worked as an investment banker in healthcare for wells fargo in san francisco, said one colleague would sometimes snort lines of crushed up adderall pills from his desk in the bullpen‚Äîthe common area where junior bankers sit and work together. ‚Äúnobody blinked an eye,‚Äù he said.

others use nicotine pouches such as zyn to excess, or consume energy drinks. one banker who worked in houston between 2017 and 2019 described his colleagues drinking ‚Äúmonsterbombs‚Äù‚Äîan extra-strength 5-hour energy shot dropped into a glass filled with monster energy, chugged in one go. the caffeine payload was the equivalent of nearly five cups of coffee at once.

the feeling that the jobs can‚Äôt be done without stimulants comes as wall street is under fire for pushing junior bankers to take on dangerous workloads.

Mundane-Option5559,2024-03-02 12:25:40,"(bloomberg) -- the tobacco industry‚Äôs next big hope for a less-harmful nicotine product, the oral nicotine pouch, just received its first major legal challenge in a lawsuit that says philip morris international‚Äôs zyn product is addictive and harmful to young people.

  
the lawsuit says that the pouches deliver more nicotine than cigarettes, and that philip morris benefits from ‚Äúzynfluencers‚Äù who promote the brand on social media, with an estimated 30,000 tiktok accounts that use the hashtag #zyn.

  
the single plaintiff, bailey wolters, alleges addiction and dental issues as a result of his zyn use. the suit, seeking class-action status, also names as a defendant stockholm-based swedish match, which made the pouches before a philip morris affiliate bought it for $16 billion in 2022.

  
the companies failed to warn about the risk of addiction and other harmful effects like cognitive issues, cardiovascular injuries, gastrointestinal problems and gum disease, the lawsuit says. it cites a study showing that zyn is gaining popularity with teens because of marketing, and others that say nicotine use in adolescence has lasting adverse consequences for brain development.

  
philip morris didn‚Äôt immediately return a message seeking comment. the stamford, connecticut-based company said in a recent email exchange regarding zyn that its products ‚Äúare not for those who don‚Äôt already use nicotine products, and never for those below the legal age of purchase.‚Äù

  
zyn has become something of a conservative cause celebre in the us in recent months, with representative marjorie taylor greene of georgia calling for a ‚Äúzynsurrection‚Äù after senate majority leader chuck schumer of new york pushed for a federal investigation of the product‚Äôs marketing. former fox news host tucker carlson has praised zyn effusively.

  
the case was brought by the law firm, schlesinger law offices pa, whose initial lawsuit against juul labs investors including altria group inc. expanded into thousands of legal actions and led to altria‚Äôs eventual settlement of $235 million.

MMKK6,2024-11-26 07:53:49,"this is a revamp of my tier list of us nicotine pouches from a couple months ago. i‚Äôve tried some other european brands, but i‚Äôm going to keep it to the us versions of pouches.

##s tier: zyn
zyn leads the pack for us users. the standout feature is how hard their 6mg pouches hit comparable to other brands‚Äô higher mg options. while the flavors are just okay, the buzz and dry pouch design make up for it. the flavorless option is a hidden gem. zyn‚Äôs consistency and reliability make it the best option.

##a tier: lucy (high a, previously s)
lucy still offers some of the best flavors apple ice remains a personal favorite, but the appeal of their regular pouches has faded. i used to like the regular pouches more than the breakers but the breakers have become the highlight. the bursts of flavor that last for hours and feel more satisfying. the regular pouches, even at 12mg, don‚Äôt seem as strong anymore, possibly due to tolerance. comfort wise, lucy‚Äôs soft pouches are still among the best, and flavors like mango breakers, apple cider breakers, and espresso are top-notch. nostalgia keeps wintergreen in the mix, but it‚Äôs not a go to. lucy‚Äôs still great, but not the game changer it once was.

##b tier: on! (low b, previously a)
on! has dropped in quality, with sharp, cheap-feeling pouches that are uncomfortable on the gums. the flavors, while decent, no longer stand out. coffee is still one of the best nicotine pouch flavors on the market, and mint is refreshing, but citrus is forgettable. on! works as a budget option but doesn‚Äôt feel special anymore.

##b tier: zone
zone is consistent but unimpressive. the nicotine strength is underwhelming, and the flavors lean too sweet and artificial. however, the pouches are very comfortable, and dragonfruit is a standout flavor. zone is solid for casual use, but it doesn‚Äôt excel in any particular area.

##c tier: rogue
rogue has great, long lasting flavors and i like the wintergreen, with policorex giving it a slow nicotine release. unfortunately, the pouches irritate gums and lips despite feeling soft initially. the flavor strength is a redeeming quality, but the discomfort keeps rogue firmly in c tier.

##c tier: velo (us version)
velo has improved, with fewer burst pouches and better overall quality. dragonfruit stands out, but most other flavors are forgettable. the us version is decent, but it still doesn‚Äôt compare to the highly-praised eu version. a good choice in a pinch, but not exceptional.

##d tier: oxbar
oxbar‚Äôs bold, vape like flavors, especially peach blue razz mint, are unique and memorable. however, the harsh burn on the gums prevents it from being a favorite. the flavor quality has improved since release, but the discomfort keeps it from rising above d tier. this are actually prerelease i got from a smoke shop that‚Äôs a front for a major wholesale site. it says ‚Äúsample not for sale‚Äù on it and the only information i can find on it is a 2firsts website from a dubai vape convention as a demo.

favorite flavors recap
* zyn: flavorless, cinnamon, menthol
* lucy: apple ice, mango breakers, apple cider breakers, espresso
* on!: coffee, mint
* zone: dragonfruit
* velo: dragonfruit
* rogue: wintergreen
* oxbar: peach blue razz mint

No_Ambition9394,2025-05-27 13:26:31,"hi everyone. sooo i‚Äôve always loved a little nicotine in my life. started out as  an occasional drunk cig at a party in college and then i didn‚Äôt touch nicotine after graduating for around 3 years. then i took up drunk cigs again, and then vaping, and finally 2 years ago i tried zyns and i never looked back. i‚Äôve quit a few times here and there and after a few months, i‚Äôll start back up again. i have hashimotos and hypothyroidism and weight gain is inevitable for me, especially during flare ups. so recently i‚Äôve been working out more and finally getting some weight off, and aside from the minor appetite suppressant i feel from the zyns, i think what really helps me as whenever i‚Äôm craving a snack, i just pop a zyn in and by the time the flavor is gone i don‚Äôt want the snack any longer. it has really really helped me cut down on my cravings. but my addiction is getting out of control (in my mind) i‚Äôm going through 1 can of 3mg every two days, and i would like to quit. 

has anyone else tried the zero nicotine pouches out there. i want to still be able to pop a pouch in my mouth when i‚Äôm having cravings, and so far nothing works like the zyns. i‚Äôve tried mints, gum, tic tacs, etc. 

or if anyone else has any suggestions for me on how to handle the food cravings once i do quit for good that would be great too! i‚Äôve experienced that side effect first hand and i‚Äôve always ended up packing on 5-10 lbs while quitting.

i got put on 40mg of nexium for 2 weeks and then when i got my endoscopy i got put on 6 weeks of nexium. i am supposedly ‚Äúhealed‚Äù which is what the doctor said, it takes 6 weeks for an oesophagus to heal, but i do sometimes get really bad days.

i keep a diary of every day and what i eat. and this month i actually had an entire week of bliss, no issues at all! and then today i‚Äôm just feeling at a total loss. terrible dysphasia and exhausted after eating. also a lot of anxiety while eating. does anyone know if these peaks and troughs are normal. does it really only take 6 weeks to heal. 

i have an appointment in april to check up on me, i assume just a doctor asking me how i‚Äôve been, but what can they do for me. has anyone experienced this. i‚Äôm feeling at a total loss, i feel so defeated as i keep thinking it‚Äôs finally gone, it‚Äôs finally gone, and then it comes back.

ProfessionalCut8906,2025-01-23 05:37:51,"i'm sure some of you are aware of what happens when you fall asleep with a nicotine pouch in your mouth, or a patch, or gum, or i've even heard chantix (think it's off the market now), these things all cause incredibly vivid dreams. 

now i'm an on! user which is why i made this post. i had another wicked and whacky dream again. to illustrate, in pouch dreams as i like to call them, i can absolutely control what i want to do and where i want to go. i'm still in the fucked up dream world, but i have more conscious thoughts there. and of course the entire thing feels more vivid. i would say it's on par with a lucid dream -- i've brought back pieces of knowledge, text i've seen written down, and even a song that just blew my mind how clear it sounded. when i woke up, i went around the house and asked if anyone was playing music. nope, i dreamed that. 

but pouch dreams are a beast to be tamed. i've had my fair share of scary pouch dreams. i got shot in one and i could feel it! luckily i was able to wake myself up (another interesting feature of these dreams, i know i'm dreaming, and if it's fun, i continue on in dream world to explore) and not have to dream of being shot anymore lol. it felt almost exactly how i would imagine it. 

though these dreams aren't for the weak, they're surely worth a try for anyone who has wanted a cheap and relatively safe way to explore lucid dreaming. i've never swallowed one of these things by the way. and my mouth does taste gross when i wake up. maybe try doing patches if you're not into that. 

i'm just a sleepy type of guy so i tend to pass out without noticing once the sun goes down, i am out. and i'll pass out with a damn pouch in my mouth",2,zyn pouches,110,0.9942,0.185,0.771,0.044,positive

Amanroth87,2025-01-13 11:03:48,"first let me say that i quit smoking about 5 years ago. i originally posted to this sub 4 years ago, celebrating 8 months without a cigarette. in that 5 years, i have tried on two occasions to smoke. i think i smoked about half a cigarette the one time, and the second time i puked after my first puff. these were both during times of peak stress in my life. haven't touched one since, and i count myself very lucky to have made it this far. i want to thank you all for your tremendous support in what was a difficult time in my life, and i'm sure that i'll never smoke again even though i've been tempted to light up at other occasions.

about a year ago, zonnic flavored nicotine pouches became available at convenience stores across my country. now, i've had my experiences with vaping... i got rid of my vapes when i quit smoking entirely, but occasionally i will take a puff of one when i'm visiting with someone who uses them so you can't consider me entirely nicotine-free. however, when these pouches became readily available, i jumped on the bandwagon because i was curious to try them. big mistake. they market them as an nrt, but i'd say they are more of a method to target new users who don't wish to have bad breath and stinky clothes.

since then, they've removed them from stores and now sell them exclusively in pharmacies which i think was probably a good idea. i go to concerts and i see them littered in the garbage cans and urinals, and there have been times where the entire stock of a store or pharmacy is depleted so i assume they are reasonably popular. for me what was originally just a mild curiosity in the product has become an addiction... i put a fresh one in my mouth hourly, from the time i wake up to the time i go to sleep. i seem to have withdrawals during the night, causing me to have weird and vivid dreams where i usually wake up in a cold sweat. i want to stop, but i find myself picking them up every time i run low. i've noticed that my gum lines appear to be receding in the areas in my mouth where i put them, and i'm genuinely afraid of the withdrawal process that i'm going to go through when i take the plunge and give them up entirely.

any advice, or experiences to share regarding these hell pouches. this community encouraged me once before, i'm hoping to find the strength to quit again.",3,zyn pouches,113,0.7996,0.091,0.841,0.068,positive

ilikedeh,2025-03-03 01:06:47,"yesterday being sunday- a chilled afternoon- discussions about drugs came up. i've only ever used alcohol(not often), weed (less often) and moly (tried it once). nothing outside that. i mention that i'd like to try at least every drug once in my lifetime; hence the decision to start with nicotine pouches. 

we go get some and i'm kinda excited to try one. i pop one in when we get back to the house and it takes a few tries to get it to sit right at the base behind my bottom lip. felt so badass at this point lol. a few minutes in, ai, nothing. so i start throwing shade at the hype when my mouth starts to taste something... finally. now listen, it went downhill from here. 

kidogo kidogo, my buccal cavity (and throat) start to feel dry. i drink water but it's like i'm making it worse. this was closely followed by me feeling gassy. wewe! wacha nianze kunyamba nyamba (hahaha lol). but guess what. i still don't feel the high... until... i bent over to pick something and it hit me with a blow. 

i start feeling a very strange head rush, a lot of heat so i undress and the palpitations were crazy. removed the pouch when i started feeling nauseous - i did vomit shortly after. came back to the sitting area saying i feel better only for me to rush to the washroom again because this time my rectum felt like it was about to explode with poop. 

my body feels better but i'm still high and uncomfortable (i can relate the discomfort to how motion sickness feels like). in an effort to undo the high, i try to chugg a lot of water, heck i even tried to dance like i was in the club (this made it worse), i tried to sleep but the nausea!  tried to cook because maybe food will help but i couldn't stand the smell. eventually i just sat there in defeat as i waited for my body to self regulate back to the norm.

dispensieve,2025-02-20 19:28:22,"disclaimer: english is not my first languageüòÅ

hello quitters! 
i know there are already many stories like mine in this thread but i just really need to write it all down and get it off my chest.

i smoked cigarettes for ten years. when i was 26 i finally quit smoking but only so i could get addicted to nicotine pouches, yayy. i've been using them for about a year now, 7-10 per day (11mg of nicotine/pouch). 

two months ago i had super annoying 10 days, i suddenly felt dizzy all the time, exhausted but what was worse, i had headache every single day, every morning i woke up with a headache, over the counter painkillers wouldn't help and the last day i had such terrible migraine (i don't suffer from migraines) i called my doctor and she sent me a prescription for migraine pills and stronger painkillers and headaches finally went away. 
but my troubles barely started. since then i developed tinnitus, it was very quite in the beginning so i ignored it, i still felt dizzy though, vertigo, brain fog and some other weird symptoms like muscle twitching, sudden rapid heartbeat increase and sweating for no reason, nausea, blurred vision, not feeling hunger at all vs being hungry all the time (probably linked to nausea and digestion)
i went to several doctors only to find out my ears are okay, my brain is okay, my arteries are okay, everything with my body is okay, i'm just perfectly healthy woman. i tried literally everything i could, spent hours online googling my symptoms trying to find out what the hell could be causing all this. 
i have diagnosed depression and bpd and use ads for 7 years. recently i had my sertraline dose increased to max daily dose which was one of things that i thought might have caused my symptoms. though i'm back at my original lower dose for three weeks now and not a single thing changed. 
mostly that f-ing tinnitus and dizziness is driving me insane, my anxiety rises, i'm running out of strength and out of hope. i know people learn how to live with tinnitus but that stupid vertigo, low concentration and brain fog, that's what troubles me the most as i'm a taxi driver and now i can't drive because of this, i don't feel good and safe while driving. 
so doctors found nothing, ads probably aren't the cause either, i started to take vitamins regularly, exercise daily (cervical spine mostly), meditate, reduced caffeine, just trying to do everything possible. 

and the very last thing in my life that might be causing my symptoms is the only thing i haven't thought of until today. 
my tinnitus is usually better for a little while in the morning, right after i wake up and before i get up. yeah but i take velo like three minutes after opening my eyes so it kinda makes sense. 
when i look back it fits (yeah my pessimistic side is telling that high dose of sertraline fitted as well) but i can't give up on this last bit of hope or i'll have nothing else left. all this time i was trying to find out what's wrong with me and i didn't even think of nicotine. omg, i suspected caffeine, antidepressants, some hypothetical deadly disease and didn't think nicotine might have some negative effects on my health. my brain fog is definitely fogging damn hardüòÅ 

guys, for the first time in these 11 years of using nicotine i feel a real urge to stop. until today i never felt like quitting, i didn't even want to, didn't try to, i loved it, both cigarettes and the pouches. it helped me a lot while quitting alcohol and with anxiety. but it ends here! 
if anyone finished this stream of my late thoughts (damn it's 4am) i thank you for your attention and i wish you all including me all the best, lot of strength and much love üíï ",10,velo pouches,119,0.977,0.148,0.729,0.123,positive
mrtyrd,2025-04-15 02:41:21,"i was concerned today to see representatives for ‚Äúvelo‚Äù giving out free nicotine pouches at bristol temple meads. they seemed to be particularly targetting students and young people passing through the station. 

i‚Äôm aware that these products are currently not regulated in the uk like vapes / tobacco, but health research groups are have flagged growing concerns around the targeting of young people to what is an addictive product, with limited data available on the long term health impacts.

understand these pouches are in theory less harmful than smoking / vaping and if people want to spend their money on them then it‚Äôs their call, but it seems to fly in the face of public health policy that it‚Äôs ok to actively target young people to take up addictive substances from inside the rail station (presumably with significant cash going to gwr for the privilege).

anyone with more awareness on these issues thoughts would be very welcome and if anyone could advise of appropriate routes raise a concern to the council that would be great!

**commonly asked questions** 

- **what does this mean.** - *this means if you order these there is a risk you may not receive your order.*

- **how do products get added to the red list.** - *it's random, nobody knows.*

- **i'm using x product sold in the us, but that name is on the red list, how.** - *products like velo, general, white fox, and others are sold in the us.  these aren't on the red list.  only their european version that is imported.*

specific red list links:  [here](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_1163.html), and [here](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_1169.html).  and here's the [master list for sweden](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/country_se.html).

---------

**regarding shipping times to the us**

here is some info about shipping to the us.

1.  in the old days, most stores processed orders within 24 hours.  at most, some would take 48 hours to process an order.  now, it‚Äôs not unheard of for the two remaining stores to take many, many days to process an order.
2.  once the order is out of the stores hands, the speed of shipping is not under their control.  this goes for every e-store that ships to the us.
3.  clearance times are controlled by the fda / ups and the store has nothing to do with these.
4.  clearance is normal.  warehouse scans are normal.  location scans are normal.  
5.  the speed that clearance happens is random.  also, the store has no control over this.
6.  the speed in which you get your delivery is random.  the store also has no control over this.
7.  orders can get to you in as quick as 2 days, or can take much longer.  a few weeks, or even up to a month or two.  again, the stores have no control over this, it is entirely up to ups / fda.
8.  you may be charged extra duty on delivery, [here is info about that](https://old.reddit.com/r/snus/comments/1kkx8um/info_buying_online_cost_effectiveness_with_duties/.).

---------

**stores shipping to the us**

note:  snus sales are not banned to the us.  some products are on the ""red list"", but many are not.  some stores have decided to stop selling to the us, but that is the store's choice, not an official act or ban from the us against import (at this time).

- shipping snus to the us:  [snusport.com](http://www.snusport.com), [swedishproducts.online (note:  may incur duty fees](http://www.swedishproducts.online), [mrsnuff.com](http://www.mrsnuff.com).

- not currently shipping snus to the us:  buysnus.com, mysnus.com, snus24.com, snus.us, snuscentral.com, snusdaddy.com, snusdirect.com, snusexpress.com, snusroom.com, snusline.com, snusme.com (many of these are shipping nicotine pouches to the us, but not snus)

---------

**if you order red list products, it is at your own risk!**

1.  the [red list](https://old.reddit.com/r/snus/comments/1hssf01/us_shipping_fda_red_list_available_stores_and_ups/) is available, on this sub.  i keep it updated anytime a product is added.
2.  if you order a red list product, it may get through, it may not.  you order these products at your own risk.
3.  it is not the fault of any e-store if they don't get through, are returned, or are destroyed.
4.  we advise you not to complain to the store, or try to do a chargeback, because this may lead to the last store shipping snus to us to stop completely.

---------

**should i do a chargeback on my order.**

we have four remaining stores shipping snus to the us. we do not want to make them angry. if you are doing chargebacks on your orders, they may decide it isn't worth the risk to ship to us anymore and we won't be able to get snus.  **ordering in 2025 is at your own risk!**  making a snus order online, this is a risk we all have to assume. we may get our stuff. we may not. we may get all of our order. we may not. red-list stuff is also at your own risk - you may get it, you may not. you may not get your entire order. it's up in the air. but don't make the last four stores regret shipping to us and completely pull from the us market.",62,velo pouches,195,-0.9886,0.02,0.911,0.068,negative

GimmeThatHotGoss,2024-03-10 19:02:07,"so, i noticed the zyn's have become a bit of a meme on the show - and i just want to point out that there is no such thing as harmless nicotine - and no such thing as harmless nicotine advertising. 
i work with a large anti-tobacco campaign in the united states, and we've been working with them to monitor tobacco advertising on social media that targets kids -- this has evolved from cigarettes to vaping (juul), to heated tobacco (iqos), and now pouches / snus (zyn's). so many podcasts (shulz, kreisher, rogan) are promoting the product without disclosing their financial relationship and sponsorship - and all of those podcasts have young audiences who can't legally buy cigarettes. (ps. tobacco advertising is not allowed on all major social media platforms). 

so, when i see andrew shulz bullying his guests to try them, call them pussies if they don't - it hits different. i know what's behind that, and i know the effect that's going to have on a young audience. 

big tobacco has always targeted ""new customers"" and know from research that lifelong nicotine addiction starts at a young age - because you are less likely to get addicted later in life or pick up the habit. they need smoking to be cool, vaping to be cool, snus to be cool. they need you to be a pussy if you don't do it.

right now, there isn't enough research about snus and lifelong addiction or the ""gateway"" effect. however, what we do know about vaping and addiction may also be true about snus. 

""evidence does indicate that young non-smokers who use e-cigarettes, also a nicotine product, are 3x more likely to progress to conventional cigarette use compared to non-smokers that do not use e-cigarettes.""

""teens who start vaping are nearly three times more likely to go on to smoke cigarettes than their peers who don‚Äôt use any type of tobacco product, a new study finds.""

we track the use of social influencers globally using social listening and research software, and publish reports about how tobacco companies violate laws, platform rules, and who standards on tobacco advertising - they do this all the time - because enforcement is limited. we were part of the team whose research was used to pressure philip morris into admitting they were doing this back in 2019 - https://www.reuters.com/article/iduskcn1sh02k/ 

and here they all are, doing it again with pouches, moving the needles until the next round of restrictions and public health policies are put in place. with their astro-turk campaigns like: pmi's ""smoke free future"" or bat's velo marketing:

from podcasts, to music festivals, to f1, to every ""grwm"" tik-tok influencer stuffing their iqos into their purse. they can't traditionally advertise joe camel, so this is where those billions have moved. 

""according to reports by the guardian, bat has invested ¬£1bn on marketing campaigns that harness the appeal of influencers, music stars and sporting events to market velo, the company‚Äôs nicotine pouch product.""

https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/what-we-do/global/nicotine-pouches

Direct-Detective2005,2025-01-24 16:17:27,"why does a 3mg zyn feel stronger to me than a 9mg fre pouch.

recently, zyn has been almost impossible to find where i live and it has been my go-to nicotine pouch ever since i stopped smoking when i discovered it for sale at a convenience store in 2017. due to not being able to get my hands on a decent amount of zyn recently i decided to try some other brands, but for some reason i‚Äôm having trouble finding one that gives me a nicotine buzz that even feels close to what i‚Äôve experienced with zyn. out of curiosity i decided to try a few of the ‚Äúhigher strength‚Äù options but to my surprise i‚Äôve found that even a 9mg fre pouch wasn‚Äôt able to provide a strong enough dose to satiate my nicotine requirements. tried 8mg lucy, still no. tried 8mg 2one pouches, nope. the only one that has even come slightly close has been the new 6mg velo plus pouches. 

i‚Äôm confused. what‚Äôs the deal with pouch strength. am i missing something. are they lying about how much nic there is. how could a 3mg dry pouch feel so much more powerful than a 9mg moist pouch. is it me. do i have some kind of nicotine firewall installed in my brain that only lets phillip morris international through.

Deer_reeder,2024-02-13 10:41:12,"nicotine is harmful to the body in many ways. the problem is not just that it is addictive. 

pouches, vaping, gum, lozenges‚Ä¶all nicotine is terribly harmful. not just cigarettes!

i finally stopped using nicotine completely a year ago, when i had a bone fracture that would not heal. 

nicotine drastically slows healing and can even prevent bone healing. did you know that.. i didn‚Äôt.

frustrated and in pain after 9 months of pain and suffering, despite treatment for a spinal fracture,i was considering surgery.  

i had truthfully answered ‚Äúno‚Äù when asked if i smoked, but finally the bone specialist mentioned that it was odd i wasn‚Äôt healing, unless i was using nicotine. 

that information from the doctor stunned me.

i intermittently was vaping or chewing gum, not even heavily, just a little bit daily. 

immediately i stopped using all nicotine and the fracture healed rapidly.

i share this story because i am so angry that the tobacco industry is pushing product so hard to people, very young people in particular. 

the line of bull is not refuted near enough:  nicotine is relatively safe as long as it is not smoked. 

that is a lie. 
categorically, nicotine is toxic, it is poison. short term and long term use is absolutely detrimental to your health. 

the us should run a balls out campaign of the damage done to the cardiovascular system, the nervous system, and the musculoskeletal system, all that nicotine is culpable for.

it is appalling, the amount of googling and searching to find hard facts. plenty of vague info about using products other than cigarettes, for the purpose of quitting cigarettes. you will read how these products are ‚Äúrelatively harmless‚Äù and you will see the cute packaging and notice how easy it is to use them without anyone knowing. the products are just as expensive as cigarettes are now and they are just as addictive. 

yet, there are only mild warnings from government and medical sites. often, there are paywalls to get to scientific facts and studies. for non-medical professionals, like me, reading and comprehending the facts is a challenge.

in other words, the industry has put a lot of $$$$$ into keeping us ignorant.

obviously, funding should be provided by every company involved in the production, marketing, and sales of nicotine for human consumption.

now my nic intake is like 75% less than when i was using pouches. 

people market it as the safest form of nicotine but it's not. it's not safe for the cardiovascular system at all. 

the safest form of nicotine is vaping. everything else is too much and too unhealthy for the body. 

with zyns i was absorbing amounts of 1 pack of cigarettes or more per day, something that i never did before zyns. zyns didnt do any good to me actually. 
but vaping is much better than smoking and the total nicotine intake is much lower. 

zyn and nicotine pouches are a scam trap. people stupidly rave about lung free health but they never mention how it affects the cardiovascular system. 

zyns are only for when you can't smoke or vape for like 10 hours so u put one in. only one though. not snusing all day long. this is even worse habit than smoking or vaping.

i realize that all people who rave about zyns and pouches and tobacco snus are edgy children. even in sweden most people vape and only a small percentage use snus or pouches. they source studies about how snus improved lung health but they never link a study of how it affects the cardiovascular system. 

doing 8 x 6mg zyns per day is like smoking a pack or more of cigarettes worth of nicotine continuously steadily absorbed all day without even the in between breaks that a cigarette smoker takes.",2,zyn pouches,5,0.945,0.13,0.782,0.088,positive

## tafseer of the above-quoted verse

(2) the verse asks us to adopt a gentle tone and an open-hearted manner in speaking to others, whether they are good or evil, pious or impious, orthodox or aberrant, followers of sunnah or adherents to partitive innovations in it. in religious matter, however, one should not try to hide the truth for the sake of pleasing people or of winning their approval. the holy qur'an tells us that when allah sent sayyidna musa and sayyidna harun (moses and aaron) (ÿπŸÑ€å€ÅŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ) to the pharaoh ŸÅÿ±ÿπŸàŸÜ ÿå he instructed them to use gentle and soft words (20:42). ___none of us who addresses another today can be superior to sayyidna musa (ÿπŸÑ€å€Å ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ) ÿå nor can the man addressed be viler than the pharaoh ŸÅÿ±ÿπŸàŸÜ.___

talha ibn 'umar recounts that once he said to the great master of the sciences of exegesis and hadith, 'at-a' ÿπÿ∑ÿßÿ° ÿå ""one can see around you people who are not quite orthodox in their beliefs. as for me, i am rather short-tempered. if such people come to me, i deal with them harshly."" 'ata' replied, ""do not behave like this,"" and, reciting the present verse, he added, allah has commanded us to speak to people politely. when jews and christians all are to be treated like this, would this commandment not apply to a muslim, no matter what kind of a man he is."" (qurtubi)

haarp1,2024-12-15 13:52:29,"a wall street journal investigation in august about bank of america‚Äôs treatment of young bankers put a spotlight on long hours that violate its policies and cause health problems. one junior banker died in may after putting in over 100 hours a week for about a month to finish work on a $2 billion acquisition. after the article‚Äôs publication, bank of america and the wider industry said they would crack down on overwork. morgan stanley, for example, now asks junior bankers to report their hours and will intervene in some cases to make sure they don‚Äôt go over 80 hours a week. 

still, interviews with more than 50 current and former investment bankers at over a dozen banks about how they cope with long hours and high-pressure jobs made clear that the use of stimulants is openly discussed and visible in workplaces. 

most banks mentioned in this article either declined to comment or didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment. 

broadly speaking, some banks said they were focused on improving working conditions for employees. some said they viewed these examples as isolated cases and said employees made their own health decisions regarding prescription medication.

‚Äòa very, very important tool‚Äô

trevor lunsford, a mergers-and-acquisitions banker for ascend capital in washington, d.c., said he has taken adderall for seven years. ‚Äúit‚Äôs a very core, integral component of my life, and to me, something that is a very, very important tool,‚Äù he said.

he said that for a month he took a 6 a.m. flight to denver early in the week, connecting through detroit, to meet with clients of the bank. he would spend eight hours at a management presentation, then go to dinner for four hours after that.

‚Äúfor a couple of days of the week, it was very regularly a 20-22 hour day,‚Äù he said. ‚Äúthat‚Äôs something that i would not have been able to be on for, be focused and be quick with decisions if i wasn‚Äôt able to take adderall.‚Äù

around 14 million people had prescriptions for adhd medication at the end of 2022, up 26% from 2012, according to numbers provided to the justice department by pharmaceutical data firm iqvia. easier access to the drugs through online health services has driven a surge in new prescriptions, particularly among adults. first-time adderall prescriptions increased 27% for people aged 30-44 in 2024 from 2021, according to medical insights firm truveta.

adderall and vyvanse, another commonly prescribed adhd drug, are classified as schedule 2 drugs, on par with cocaine and opioids because of their high potential for abuse. abuse can cause frenetic behavior and heart problems. 

samuel glazer, a new york psychiatrist who counsels high-powered bankers working on wall street, said the long-term effects of drugs such as adderall haven‚Äôt been adequately studied, and that they can often be gateways to more dangerous substances. he said he has had clients come in after they tried to buy pills from drug dealers because they ran out of their monthly prescription.

he said the immense financial rewards of working on wall street‚Äîstarting banker salaries can reach $200,000‚Äîcan push people to use drugs to improve their performance, saying ‚Äúthe only way to work these hours is if you are really, really driven to perform.‚Äù

he said he worried that the destigmatization of amphetamines in a work setting will lead many to lifelong dependencies. ‚Äúmany of my patients think about taking stimulants just like they would think about taking multivitamins or dietary supplements,‚Äù he said. ‚Äúthis is much more casual than opioids were 20 years ago.‚Äù

boutique health clinics such as new york‚Äôs trifecta health, used by moran, and the telehealth sites that boomed during the pandemic have eased access to adhd drugs. 

edward fruitman, a psychiatrist who owns and operates trifecta, said 50% of his clientele comes from wall street. he said they turn to him because they say their high-octane jobs are nearly impossible to do unassisted. ‚Äúthere is a limit to what any human being can really produce and do,‚Äù he said, adding that the difficulties at work could be a sign of untreated adhd.

for adhd patients, ‚Äúi was trying to create a system that does not throw any other obstacles in the way of treatment,‚Äù he said. the doctor said the clinic sought to prevent stimulant abuse and looked for signs of drug seeking behavior.

trifecta doesn‚Äôt take insurance. patients pay $350 for an initial consultation and $240 every month thereafter. after the pandemic started, trifecta began to offer telehealth services. (fruitman also operates a plastic surgery business, offering botox, filler and face-lifts, and has a psychiatric practice that includes addiction counseling.)

moran visited the clinic from 2016 to 2019, spending over $5,000. he eventually switched drugs to vyvanse instead of adderall, and his prescription steadily increased to 70 milligrams a day. he said he was told it was normal to increase dosages as users developed a tolerance to the drug. at first he visited once a month to get his prescription refilled, but he said eventually he wasn‚Äôt required to.
during his final visit, a physician assistant offered to keep his prescription at 70 milligrams of vyvanse‚Äîthe maximum daily dosage of the drug‚Äîand add on 20 milligrams a day of adderall. he didn‚Äôt agree to the new regimen, and stopped going to the clinic about a week later. 

by that time, he had a job at the boutique investment bank centerview partners in new york. he had stayed at the office preparing a pitch deck for a client until 5 a.m., went home to change clothes, then headed back to work at around 9 a.m. for a meeting with the client, taking vyvanse on the way in. 

later that morning, while tinkering with a financial model, he began having heart palpitations that felt like he had just sprinted an 800-meter race, ‚Äúexcept i was on microsoft excel instead of the track.‚Äù 
‚Äúi knew that i needed to stop,‚Äù he said. 

monthlong detox

frey, the wells fargo banker, received an adderall prescription from teladoc, an online healthcare company, in 2020. 

he wanted to try it because some of his colleagues took the drug and had told him it helped them cope with the long hours. it wasn‚Äôt unusual to start some days in the san francisco office at 4 a.m., to be awake for calls with the bank‚Äôs clients on the east coast, and stop around 2 a.m. the next day. 

in 2021, he took a new job in new york at leerink partners, the former investment banking arm of silicon valley bank, where he was working to build out a healthcare-focused team. 

on top of building complex financial models and 100-slide presentations to win key advisory roles for big mergers and acquisitions, he was working on business development and helping less-experienced analysts learn the job. ‚Äúmy workload went up at least two- or threefold, and that‚Äôs when things started to go south,‚Äù he said.

during his monthly appointments with teladoc, he told clinicians he was working a lot more than in the past, and they offered to up his dosage. he agreed. 

‚Äúi started taking it once in the morning and then once in the afternoon, at first for five days a week, and then it became seven days a week because i was working most weekends,‚Äù he said. 

he began to lose track of what day of the week it was because the pills whipped him into a nonstop productive frenzy. he lost his appetite and dropped around 25 pounds. 

finally, he quit the job in 2022 and stopped taking the drug.
he moved back in with his parents. it took about a month to feel normal again. he got cold sweats in the evening and would either sleep for 12 hours straight or not sleep at all. he tried to stay productive, including by learning french through the app duolingo.
‚Äúi went in understanding the downside risks‚Äù of using adderall, he said. ‚Äúbut the reward was making managing director and pulling in a seven-figure salary. i felt that i had to have an edge to make it.‚Äù
after stopping the drug, ‚Äúi had to basically relearn the basics of how to operate as a human being in society, outside of the realm of just going to the office and working yourself to death,‚Äù he said. he enrolled in business school two months after he stopped taking the drug and now is back to work.

zyn pyramids

some bankers use nicotine pouches such as zyn and energy drinks to power through tedious work, including building large financial models where one incorrectly typed equation can ruin an entire project, or spending hours pulling together obscure financial figures about private companies for prospective buyers.

zyn, a product of swedish match, which is owned by philip morris international, comes in hockey-puck size containers of 15 pouches‚Äîa user places one between the lip and gum. some bankers said they have seen colleagues use so many zyn pouches in a day they ingest the same amount of nicotine as they would by smoking a pack of cigarettes or more. empty containers are commonly stacked in pyramids around bullpens.

some analysts in the houston office of jefferies were known to put two zyn pouches in at a time while cranking out financial models and powerpoint slide decks, according to three people who worked there. 
they said zyn helped bankers cope with a major spike in hours this year, when they would work until 4 a.m. for days in a row on big deals, such as the $26 billion merger of diamondback energy and endeavor energy.  

the product often sells out online and in retail stores, including at shops near investment banks. in manhattan, smiler‚Äôs deli across the street from jefferies typically sells out of zyn a few days after getting its twice-weekly shipment of nearly 100 containers, a cashier said. the store had a bag of competitor brands behind the counter to offer to customers who need a fix as it waited for its next delivery. 

changed personality

prescription medications are widely used to get through the long days on wall street.

one former banker said he started taking adderall while working at guggenheim partners in new york between 2017 and 2019 after realizing that many others were on it. at the office, ‚Äúthere were pill bottles everywhere,‚Äù he said.

a banker at wells fargo said he takes 50 milligrams of vyvanse each morning and 20 milligrams of adderall some evenings. a typical starting dose is either 30 milligrams of vyvanse or 5 milligrams of adderall a day, according to glazer. 

because of an ongoing shortage of adhd medications, the banker often struggles to find a pharmacy that can fill his prescription. he has a list of around 10 he tries each month. he said he realized he was addicted when he found himself sitting in traffic on a city bus in queens, nearly an hour from his office, to get to a pharmacy that could fill his prescription. 

he also said he has felt himself become antisocial and isolated from using the medication over the years. 

he said the amphetamines hinder his ability to have casual conversations at work because he feels anxious and laser-focused on working. instead of socializing, he exercises almost every night at a gym near his apartment or plays videogames by himself. 

he said he felt the drugs make him robotic and highly transactional, unable to entertain the idea of socializing with strangers‚Äîbecause he sees no immediate value-add.

one woman who worked in commodities finance in boston found adderall to be a miracle drug for the first year, giving her so much energy that she would work late into the night and stay at the office for 48 hours. she said that on the drug, she could focus on analyzing obscure trends in commodities markets and build complex forecasts of power prices for hours without needing a break.

she lost around 30 pounds and was rarely eating, but she was succeeding at work and decided not to think too much about it.

over time, she said the drug altered her personality, making her overconfident and financially irresponsible. she would take short breaks at work to gamble with her savings by investing in penny stocks.

after nearly two years, she realized she depended on the drug to have the energy to do anything. she tried to quit cold turkey. she stopped going to work and started to lose thousands of dollars on her risky investments in penny stocks, but she didn‚Äôt sell off the bad bets because she felt no motivation to go anywhere or do anything.  
in 2021, she quit her job, sold off the stocks and moved to california for a time. she has struggled with depression and relapses since then.

adderall is also widely bought as a street drug. but the risk is that counterfeit pills can be contaminated with fentanyl, an often deadly opioid. two college students at ohio state university died in 2022 after taking counterfeit adderall pills that contained fentanyl. 

glazer, the new york psychiatrist, said people who misuse stimulants are more prone to seek out other types of drugs.

michael bloom, 29, joined royal bank of canada in new york in 2022, eager to prove himself after transferring into investment banking. his team worked on deals in the financial technology industry, and two people who worked on the team said it was known for long hours and high turnover. 

a superior pulled bloom aside and voiced concern that he was using adderall to manage his workload, a person close to bloom said. bloom told him he didn‚Äôt think it was an issue that he was taking the pills, and that he needed them to concentrate. 

on april 11, 2023, bloom went home from the office around 7 p.m. and worked through the night from home, according to three people familiar with his schedule. one person on his team pinged him around 9 p.m. to see if he had more bandwidth to start working on a new project, and bloom said he couldn‚Äôt because he was already too busy, one of the people said. he took another call around 3:30 a.m. from someone he worked with, two of the people said. 

his wife found him dead on the floor the next morning. an autopsy concluded he died accidentally from acute intoxication from the combined effects of fentanyl and ethanol. it couldn‚Äôt be learned how the fentanyl entered his system.

a spokeswoman for rbc said, ‚Äúwe remain extremely saddened by the loss of our colleague and friend. our thoughts continue to be with his family.‚Äù",1,zyn pouches,10,-0.9884,0.034,0.901,0.065,negative

anyway, yeah this would be an opportune time to get some stock once it dips due to the publicity of the case but probably want to wait till the verdict possible. going down if they lose, goes even or slightly up if they win. not sure if the suit is settled out of course if so then stock probably stays its course. but it will course correct overtime because people have goldfish memories and forget about the companies that tried to fuck them over as long as they can make money off them or they like their product.",9,zyn pouches,11,0.8711,0.143,0.778,0.079,positive

people importing counterfeit pouches from producers in china.

easy way to spot fakes are:

-strong smell from pouches or unopened tin

-bottom edges of the tins are sharp

-labels are miscut or aren‚Äôt centred properly

-labels have improper colour

-tins are harder to break the seal on

when i was growing up, that whole look was considered lame. maybe it‚Äôs because millennials connected more with rap culture‚Äîat least, that was the case for me growing up in atlanta, where it was just part of the culture. even now, my style leans more toward skate, snowboard, surf, and streetwear, which makes sense since i live in a ski town and actually spend my time snowboarding and going on surf trips. so, at least i‚Äôm not out here pretending to be something i‚Äôm not.

but these gen z guys in my ski town. they‚Äôre rocking this southern cosplay and, with it, adopting the politics that come with the look. it‚Äôs like they feel the need to back it up by leaning into certain ideologies. on top of that, i think a lot of gen z men struggle with dating and attraction, and instead of figuring it out, they just get bitter. if they can‚Äôt prove they‚Äôre ‚Äúmen‚Äù by getting laid, they try to prove it by punching down‚Äîand that attitude fits right into the gop playbook.

in the past, men and women had far more non-intimate social interactions in various spheres and social spaces, with both acting a moderating influences on one another and exposing each other to differing ideas and worldviews

men and women who leaned too far into behaving like a walking stereotype,, or embodied the worst traits associated with their gender, would generally face social rejection unless they evolved in some way. now they can all retreat into online echo chambers filled with similarly pathological individuals

of course, that's true of how the internet has impacted every type of sub-grouping and subculture. no one has to care more about other people or become a better person in order to avoid being ostracized. the people who have the worst and most ignorant beliefs just band together, forming communities where they encourage each other to embrace whatever qualities caused the majority of society to reject them in the first place",3,zyn pouches,40,-0.7839,0.117,0.745,0.137,negative

""a key that opens any lock is a master key, a lock that can be opened by any key is a shitty lock"" was the reply for why women were sluts and men studs for when both had sex with a lot of people.

feminism meant nothing more than girls should get equal rights and paid the same for the same job. no one had heard the term toxic masculinity or white privlage or anything like that. young people were hyper a-pplitical in this era. the entire culture hated young girls openly and everything they liked. boy bands were the lames dumbest thing ever. we encourages pick me behavior and ""not like other girls"" behavior. ""you don't like twilight like all the dumb bitches right. let me explain how fight club is the best movie to ever exist."" 

the list goes on forever. every generation of young men goes thru it somewhat, but i'd say 2004-09 was the peak of this behavior ever at the start of the internet age while millennials were becoming young adults. it was super super late gen x and early millennials to mid millennials that were the worst for this. people born from 1981 to 87ish is where i'd really pinpoint the worst of if. around 2002 to 2006 college aged men is what my mind goes to when anyone mentions bro culture",5,zyn pouches,40,-0.9469,0.121,0.722,0.157,negative

these are direct quotes i got from my friends after a previous conversation over text. it seems pretty obvious, trump and conservatives managed to pander to white guys who think of themselves as everyday people, and kamala and democrats didn‚Äôt. it doesn‚Äôt matter that trump doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about the people, i guess he just managed to make it *seem* like he did.

if anything we are the generation that has rebelled against traditional ideas of masculinity or ‚Äúmachismo‚Äù the most. of course you are still always going to have your more manly men since biologically speaking, having more testosterone in your body is usually going to make you a bit more driven, competitive, aggressive, and disagreeable, which is why men drift towards sports, combat/fighting, etc. 

gen x teens and young adults during the 80s/90s for example were a million times bro-eir than us. terms like ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù didn‚Äôt exist yet and nearly all dudes played some kind of sport since if you didn‚Äôt you were looked at as a nerd, geek, dork, dweeb, loser, etc. maybe if you were into other more masculine hobbies like cars, lifting weights, hunting, certain types of music, etc you could possibly be seen as cool but jocks were usually always at the top of the social hierarchy.

plus not every society/country is the same when it comes to machismo. in most of america playing/watching football, lifting, drinking beer, eating meat, driving cars, being stoic/nonchalant, and playing video games is seen as macho, but if you aren‚Äôt an athlete, are more emotionally vulnerable, etc most people aren‚Äôt going to think you‚Äôre a loser or ‚Äúless of a man‚Äù, especially amongst millennials or gen z. being openly lgbtq+ was also seen as very effeminate and womanly not too long ago but within the past decade american millennials and zoomers have become way more accepting of the lgbtq community more so than past gens 

in other countries like mexico however, the culture is still very machismo and men from all generations are still expected to act and carry themselves a very traditionally masculine way. homophobia and transphobia is a way bigger problem there than it is in america too. but in other countries like norway, sweden, netherlands, etc the ideas of masculinity and gender are even less rigid than they are in america. women ask guys out on dates and even pay for them. in countries like india or nigeria that really doesn‚Äôt happen, even amongst zoomers.",4,zyn pouches,40,0.5995,0.074,0.86,0.066,positive

Stomass-E-Elondrysl,2025-03-05 23:19:07,"gen z actually awoke my love for bro culture.

i'm a millennial who joined the airforce 2 years after i graduated in 2012. we're talking $w4g times and polo's baby!!!

however, while in the military, it was very anti frat bro culture. you had people losing stripes for falling down stairs, a dui would get you kicked out, and under obama, they introduced the force reduction act, which allowed leaders to pretty much pick and choose who stayed in, which kicked out must of your head down hard workers, and let the brown nosers fly high into the next promotion.

the whole time i was in, it was like walking on eggshells around women because the heavy r word happened so frequently that they pretty much wouldn't do an investigation, they would just take a girls word for it, and throw you in prison. also in 2015, we were told that there would be trans soldiers who will be tasked with our jobs but due to hormone therapy, they will be ineligible for deployments, which means fewer and fewer would get there time at home.

under trump from 2016 to 2020(and you're going to hate this)
a lot of the bullshit kinda went away. the trans thing was put on backlog, we were demobilizing a few stations in iraq, and he genuinely wanted the countries that we protect to pay their dues. (i was overseas in england, and anywhere near the base was insane prices because they knew us americans were good for it, so it made my opinion some what align with what trump said) the military also felt more like a military with what we were getting involved in. 

i got out in 2020 after serving my contract, which ended under biden. i seen a lot of bad shit coming full circle because we were being punished for going against the system. the jab became a mandated thing and i know a few good airmen who were forced out, dishonorable, because they refused. (you can get caught selling cocaine, and get a discharge under general, then appeal it and get honorable) just to kind of explain that.

i can't speak much more of the military under biden, but what i can speak on, is that the woke culture is such a plague that it made me hate it. that's exactly what has happened with this younger generation. they are tired of having to pretend what gender you are, your fake name, and if you're offended. it was their entire upbringing,except for those 4 years under trump.

so of course they would elect the guy!


edit: looking at most of these replies to this, you're not going to change my mind on how i viewed the past 8 years of my life.
am i a right-wing nut job. no;  i have no allegiance to either side, only to america. if your reply is to try to prove a point about something i said, ask yourself, would you enjoy a conversation with someone who doesn't align with your political views on america saying that you're wrong for having an opinion. probably not. again, i stand by my above statement that you people are not friendly enough to help cultivate movements in the right direction and so people will easily sway to your other side simply because you're not on that side.

fren-ulum,2025-03-06 06:25:07,"weird, i had a different experience in the army in some aspects.

near base prices were high, yes, but it wasn‚Äôt the end of the world.  tipping can drivers who normally don‚Äôt ask for tips just cause americans brought tipping culture there was annoying.

the army recognized the stupid sloppy out of control ‚Äúbro culture‚Äù was hurting force readiness and let me tell you, after the 3rd consecutive weekend of getting called in because some asshole can‚Äôt contain his alcohol, you get sick of it.

and the force reduction act actually started at the top with the army, cutting out senior members of the military who were non-deployable or didn‚Äôt have current apfts and quals to get forced out first.  believe me, if we could easily get rid of window kickers, we would‚Äôve.  there were a few names that i wouldn‚Äôt have mind chaptering out, but no, we couldn‚Äôt.

i mean generally a lot of left leaning gen z people were alienated by establishment democrats. and as far as what my more conservative friend here has said, yeah the economy is fucked. i mean i am terrified of trump and what he has done, but i can't disagree with the sentiment that gen z overall was hoping for radical change and a safe world to live in. a desire that wasn't being spoken to by establishment democrats, many of whom turned around and blamed them for the loss.

i mean i've got a cousin maybe who's a lil rogan pilled and lifts, and says sketchy shit for jokes, but that's family i guess.

but that is to say i don't think the correlation is the causation or vice versa. i think that the correlation of ""bro culture"" with the alt right might just be a way of lumping together things in such a way that is easy. so old peeps can find an easy scapegoat and not have to talk to their coworkers or facebook mutuals who also voted for trump.

but i also don't want to discount the algorithmic correlation. if you were a dude and used tiktok or youtube you got some weird shit in your feed. and it would be in the weirdest way too.... some scrolled past and some didn't.

and that's also not to discount the stats of who voted for trump. i mean i personally think that discounts my fellow brethren who abstained, not that i agree with them either, and i think a lot of people look at election stats like they're a be all end all when by their nature they're incomplete.

the nicotine inside is either tobacco-derived or synthetic and is mixed with food-safe stabilizers, ph buffers like sodium carbonate, flavorings, and sweeteners such as xylitol or acesulfame k.

alternatively i believe  fre will ship to california although only unflavored i believe and there is a website snus mee or something like that where you can order directly from sweden, and there have been reports on this sub reddit that orders have successfully cleared customs and been delivered to domiciles in california. i know it sucks. it‚Äôs fucking stupid that a grown ass adult can go and buy 1000 different flavors of whiskey and vodka but god forbid they partake in any flavored nicotine because oh the kids are gonna do it and what like they‚Äôre not gonna go drink some skrewball if they want something that‚Äôs gonna make them feel good that  taste like scooby snacks regardless of whether it‚Äôs legal or not.

Kotal_Ken,2025-01-03 10:50:48,"i disagree with the people saying tapering doesn't work. i tapered off and i'm almost 2 years nicotine free. most of you who quit cold turkey cave after a month or two because you can't handle it. the success rate is abysmally low, but not because of the method being used.

reality is, both the cold turkey and tapering method work. cold turkey isn't right for everyone and every situation, and tapering isn't right for everyone and every situation. you've gotta choose the method that works best for you and your life situation. 

with that said, i switched from 6 mg zyn to 3mg zyn and used that for about a month. i gave my body time to adjust to the new dose. then i switched to 2mg on! pouches. did those for maybe 3 weeks. my final step was to switch to 2mg nicotine gum for a week (i got away from the pouches first, then nicotine....baby steps). and then i let go.

i never established a daily limit during this taper. instead, every time i thought about using a pouch, i asked myself *""do i really need one right now, or can i wait a while.""* 

every time, my answer was that i can wait awhile, and i found myself going 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and sometimes 2 hours without one. not only did this naturally cut down my daily intake, but it gave me the confidence to be able to go long stretches of time without zyn. 

this strategy worked for me. it might not work for you. but if you feel that you'll have the greatest success with tapering, and you're not just using it as an excuse to use longer, then go for it. just remember, eventually you've gotta let go. 

one final thought. my approach is a longer approach. if you want to quit the zyn pouches faster, you could switch over to the patches and follow the step down approach with those. then, if you find that you have an oral craving for pouches, amazon sells these caffeine/nootropic pouches that you can use to fill the void. i used grinds and teaza (they're bigger than zyns though), but i'm hearing great things about the nze pouches being the same size as zyn. and there's no nicotine in these pouches. 

so...there you have it. you do have options if you recognize that you don't have the mental strength for cold turkey.",11,zyn pouches,87,0.9882,0.092,0.888,0.02,positive

Bencu20,2025-01-03 05:24:43,"not sure what answer you expect. i personally don't really believe that the gradual approach works, especially if you're already on only 3 pouches of 6mg, sounds more like postponing the inevitable. if you really want to, any lower dose that you can gradually decrease will get you closer. so maybe 3 3mg pouches/day for a week, than just 2 etc 

but honestly, if you manage on just 3 per day i don't think your withdrawals will be bad, and def not longer than a few days.",6,zyn pouches,87,-0.2564,0.075,0.83,0.096,negative

i've seen that the price of copenhagen varies significantly based upon each state. i guess each state has a more expensive or a less expensive tobacco tax. i can get copenhagen across the border for me in kentucky for anywhere between five dollars a can or up to 550 per can. and when you go to casey's general store, you usually get a discount when purchasing a minimum of two cans. but i also use my copenhagen coupons at casey's which save a lot of money. i don't think i'd be dipping copenhagen if it was just around $10 per can. i would definitely switch to stoker if copenhagen was that expensive since it's so much cheaper.",1,zyn pouches,90,0.8161,0.047,0.932,0.021,positive

a years worth of doctors testing, scans, cts ,blood work , specialists. no one had any answers why this was happening to me. after an er visit a few days ago the doctor was going over a list of medications i take and he says,"" can you think of anything that has changed over the past year."".  the next day friday i realized it's the pouches, so still being so addicted i switched brands saturday and purchased zone brand.  

it has only been 24 hours, and the swelling has reduced considerably. this of course is not scientific but nothing else has worked, medications, diet,etc. .

i plan to convert to the transdermal patch and stop with the pouches totally, i can say they are more addictive as the nicotine delivery is instant, whereas with smoking you may or may not get a full shot of whatever mg is there.  just my 2 cents.",2,velo pouches,114,-0.6305,0.021,0.941,0.039,negative

mrtyrd,2025-04-16 16:23:07,"response from networks rail to my complaint:
thank you for providing feedback on your recent experience at bristol temple meads. we aim for all our customers to have a positive experience at our stations, and i‚Äôm sorry on this occasion that you feel we missed the mark.

as you would expect we have a code of acceptance that ensures promotions and advertisements within our station environment are appropriate.

firstly, i can confirm this is a valid exhibition booking which has been organised by spaceandpeople, who managed our exhibition spaces, and the correct process was followed.

as part of the agreement, velo should only target existing smokers/vapers around the station, and that they follow the challenge 25 policy. therefore, this product should not be promoted to any non-smokers or people that are underage. we will ensure that they are reminded of this.

nicotine pouches are not in breach of our code of acceptance, providing they are only promoted as a healthier alternative product to vapers and smokers.

many thanks again for taking the time to share your feedback.

snus pouches deliver high and consistent amounts of nicotine into your system which is a natural laxative and bowel stimulant.

don't worry, it will just be because you're not used to them yet, you will get used to them though.

warning!! i've found snus to be the most addictive form of nicotine i've ever used, and i was an 8 year pack a day smoker. so i'd be very careful. but if you are interested in using it, consider going to a local cigar or smoking shop and purchasing some better quality snus, such as odin or siberia.",1,velo pouches,122,0.7865,0.118,0.816,0.067,positive

Ok-Hovercraft8193,2024-12-20 21:43:29,"◊ë''◊î, once you read this you can't unread it, so i'm not terribly minding the velo plus even though it's tuned more to actual dip fans (y'all want it that weirdly faintly glycol sticky and stupidly big in your lip.), but the tube shape, combined with the mint flavors and fillers >!make chomping on it once or twice to release the last of the nicotine disgustingly exactly like chewing toothpaste.!<¬†¬†


this is probably an acceptable part of the design so you just spit it and use more, but it's faintly gross, the original version felt time release enough without that trait, and it's just a lot of weird thickener to gulp down in part to make spitting the spent pouch not a slimy mess likely to make folks around you want to hurl.¬†¬†


as much as i use these out of necessity and religious reasons (function with nicotine, really shouldn't be making flames on shabbos).. well, thank g-d there's an option to slow down from 8mg on!s and it might be more tolerable with a less what-i-mentioned texture (something more like a gummy bear, tootsie roll or gum or something.) but as is, it's hilarious but not giving reason to prefer it except, longer-lasting / slower release to calm down after getting acclimated to heart stopping amounts of nicotine.¬† just give me my nicotine and flavor i don't need more grit and agar than it takes to dole it out over an hour or two, though in fairness they probably have that duration thing going for them.¬†¬†

i don't know whether that makes the difference but ""technically"" the japanese velos are not synthetic tobacco although they look and taste like they are. rather, they contain nicotine that has been extracted from tobacco, and for that reason, meet the japanese regulations prohibiting *synthetic* nicotine (like zyn). 

the japanese velos are also exceedingly cheap. a single 15-pouch cannister costs exactly jpy 300 or $2.00 usd.

i really can't stand the us smokeless tobacco market. the flavors are garbage and all taste like bubble gum (wintergreen, mint flavors). swedish snus is like the caviar of tobacco. i have no idea why swedish snus hasn't taken over the us as it is a vastly superior product. i'm also not really sure why there seems to be a small market for general snus in the us but not much else. it seems like there would be room for expansion.

i was scanning the poorly written fda material (there are typos in it) and it seems like they singled out certain products (skruf, g√∂teborgs rap√©). why is snuscentral blocking all the other brands that aren't even mentioned on the red list. it seems like a drastic measure from someone that didn't even have a lawyer look things over and parse out exactly what it means. they could also possibly look into potential work-arounds (labeling, etc). instead they reconfigured their entire website to block all tobacco products to the us, when the language from the fda seems to be much narrower than a blanket ban. does anyone know how the other companies that are supposedly still shipping to the us are interpreting these new developments.",6,velo pouches,195,-0.2633,0.062,0.873,0.065,negative
Snusalskare,2025-01-05 11:09:33,">why is snuscentral blocking all the other brands that aren't even mentioned on the red list.

just an educated guess here, but it seems to me that the most reasonable explanation is that they (and snusdirect too) ran into problems with their ups world ease shipping contract, and were told by ups that they are not allowed to ship tobacco products at the moment (for how long, who knows).

such a contract pause/pull would have been due to ups detecting an inordinately high number of customs refusals from a particular client (if you look at the generic ups rules regarding the international shipment of tobacco products, there is a clause which states that it is the responsibility of the shipper to ensure that everything they have contracted ups to ship into a country is legal to import into that country) and an apparent breach of contract terms by the vendor. ups holds all of the cards in this case, and as a major international air freight shipper is not going to do anything to get themselves in trouble with the customs authorities in the countries where they do business, especially for the comparatively tiny amount of $ they are making from what are essentially small mom-and-pop e-tailer operations in sweden (online searches show recent annual revenue for make webo ab as only \~$3 million, which is really small business-level sales numbers, even for a tiny country like sweden; whereas ups contracts with major multi-national corporations, on the other hand, easily run into the 100s of millions annually just in shipping fee revenue alone).

at the same time, ups wants to make money, no matter how tiny and financially humble the client, so if this is indeed what is at the root of the issue, i am sure they are giving the vendors some time figure things out and come back to them with assurances as to how they are going to abide by their ups world ease contract terms going forward.

if ups becomes a no-go in the end, i suspect that the affected vendors will likely try to find a workaround (post nord maybe. dhl / deutsche post perhaps.) at some point. the us market is just too big for these vendors to fully abandon without major repercussions for their bottom lines.

so it seems like they're just exercising an abundance of caution, which makes sense given how the situation is still evolving.

the whole situation is frustrating as hell. i was set with thunder frosted, and then it was randomly discontinued a couple of years back. it took a while, but i finally managed to settle on puck spearing as a 'good enough' replacement for my beloved thunder ultra frosted. now with this new twist, i can't seem to find anyone that sells that. looking at the sheet above, it looks like n&j green ice is a spearmint flavor profile, so i'll give that a shot on my next order. i dunno why it's so damn hard to find an extra sterk spearmint, everything is peppermint or wintergreen. if anyone knows a good thunder frosted replacement, you'll be my hero forever!

after some research over the weekend, it looked like snusme was pretty well regarded, so i placed a small order with them on sunday evening. it's giving a delivery date of today, but the tracking shows it as having been warehouse scanned in philly today, and is preparing for clearance. to be honest, i'm pretty impressed with snusme, the import scan was done in philly yesterday morning. so they basically processed the order and got it to my state in under 48 hours. at this point, it's at the whims of customs and ups. i am a little concerned, since i ordered a roll of oden's cold to try, and just noticed today that the oden's brand looks to be on the red list, so we'll see what happens there.

Sandviper71,2025-02-22 21:36:55,"i would order xqs  from prilla.com  if i were using that particular brand. the site is based in america so it ships from the states as opposed to coming directly from sweden.  not sure how they get it into their warehouse so they can sell em, but whatever it is, that site is reliable. while you will wait more than a week or two, i haven't had an order take longer than that. they only sell nic pouches though. that said, they also sell whitefox and siberia all white. and shipping has been dirt cheap since they're located in the states. might be worth checking out if that is your brand..not sure why it takes as long as it does to ship, but it will arrive. least it has for me when i needed it.  if my recent order from swedishproducts gets through,  i would recommend them too. they don't have a ton of brands, but they do have actual snus and several brands such as one red, xrange rape, general, etc..  and they still ship to the us. as for postnord,  it arrived,  but still took a few weeks. it came from snusme, whom the very next day stopped shipping snus to the states. i tried the other sites allegedly still selling to the us, but when i get to checkout, i get the not shipping to us message from those sites. the  package from snusme arrived through pn, and was in a box too large for the mailbox, so the mailman knocked on the door. from what i hear, they would normally would have made me pick it up at a post office,  so reckon i was lucky.  as for being stuck with the fda, that really doesn't mean much (most likely) other than they are a pain in the ass but, just from my experience with orders of late, it will get through. i have not had one stolen by the fda gestapo yet. it's a risk, but as long as you only spend an amount  on an order you can afford to lose, then it becomes  less of a big deal should they decide to confiscate.  if nothing else, if it takes a bit to arrive to you, and you have given up on it, then suddenly it arrives out of nowhere,  it just adds to the joy of getting the package..life's little victories.......",1,velo pouches,195,-0.8976,0.048,0.879,0.073,negative

ups plans to slash 20,000 jobs this year as part of a cost-cutting drive amid the shifting global trade landscape triggered by president donald trump's tariffs.

the move comes as the shipping giant grapples with soft demand, especially from its largest customers. ups said it would also look to close 73 facilities by the end of june.

Bailbondsman,2024-03-11 04:12:56,"sorry but i have to strongly disagree with your post.

for anyone here who seems to be confused, nicotine pouches are not snus. snus is a tobacco product and is a carcinogen which means it causes cancer. snus is also banned in the eu outside of sweden, but nicotine pouches are not.

tobacco-less nicotine pouches are not carcinogenic, and there is absolutely no scientific evidence that nicotine alone causes cancer.

that being said, i have smoked cigarettes for years, more than a decade, stopping here and there for months but ultimately coming back to it.

it‚Äôs on this podcast that i first heard about nicotine pouches and have since started using them instead of smoking. of course i don‚Äôt want to be addicted to nicotine, but using nicotine pouches is infinitely better and healthier than smoking cigarettes all day, and i can definitely tell the difference.

of course, no one is saying than a non-smoker should pick up nicotine out of nowhere. that was the point of the andrew schulz clip and why ethan talked about it. it was also part of what zack said when he first mentioned them- he has replaced cigarette smoking with nicotine pouches.

nicotine is horribly addictive and it‚Äôs always a terrible idea to start using it. but there are laws in place that prevent kids and teens from purchasing any nicotine products, including nicotine pouches. if companies are targeting teens with advertising, that should be stopped by laws and regulations.

but i don‚Äôt think that h3 is a podcast for teens. there are many discussions on h3 that are geared towards adults. kids and teens shouldn‚Äôt be consuming energy drinks, and an energy drink sponsors the podcast. they discuss alcohol, and ethan did a membership drive where he got almost dangerously drunk. that is definitely not content that should be consumed by anyone underage.

however, i really need to add a comment on the discussion when i‚Äôm reading someone say that a much healthier alternative to tobacco use shouldn‚Äôt be discussed on the show because the product is dangerous to teens. if it wasn‚Äôt discussed, i wouldn‚Äôt have ever known about it.",12,velo pouches,203,-0.9892,0.052,0.812,0.135,negative

yes, but shouldn't we have restrictions on how these products can be marketed. it's why we put earning labels on cigarette packs (they work) - it's why we put disclaimer's on pharma and alcohol. 

the reason tobacco companies market on podcasts is because they can avoid all of this. and, remember, all the marketing strategies that these companies undertake are focussed on youth and lifelong addiction. these are their own words, in their own documents released during court cases over the past 30 years.

okay - i‚Äôm in japanistan where aside from snus, the only available nicotine pouch at this moment seems to be velo. and, i am not 100% certain but pretty sure that they are the same as what you call velo plus elsewhere in the world.

the type of nicotine in the japanese velo (and probably the velo plus) is nicotine polacrilex. i believe that most nicotine pouches in the us contain nicotine salt instead...

 nicotine polacrilex vs. nicotine salts in nicotine pouches

nicotine polacrilex

‚Ä¢	‚Å†definition: nicotine bound to a polacrilex resin (like methacrylic acid polymer).
‚Ä¢	‚Å†purpose: gradual, controlled nicotine release, commonly used in nicotine replacement therapy (e.g., gums, lozenges).
‚Ä¢	‚Å†absorption:
	‚Å†‚Ä¢	‚Å†slower release through oral mucosa.
	‚Å†‚Ä¢	‚Å†less intense and more therapeutic.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†user experience: provides a mild, steady nicotine effect suitable for smoking cessation or controlled dosing.

 nicotine salts

‚Ä¢	‚Å†definition: nicotine combined with an acid (e.g., benzoic acid) to form a salt, reducing ph and harshness.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†purpose: faster, smoother nicotine absorption, used in recreational products like modern pouches or vapes.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†absorption:
	‚Å†‚Ä¢	‚Å†rapid absorption through oral mucosa due to better bioavailability.
	‚Å†‚Ä¢	‚Å†provides a quicker, more pronounced nicotine hit.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†user experience: delivers a strong, fast-acting effect similar to smoking or vaping.

 summary:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†nicotine polacrilex = slower, milder, therapeutic.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†nicotine salts = faster, smoother, recreational.",2,2one pouches,212,0.9737,0.1,0.895,0.006,positive
